<hr class="chap" />


<p>The Author has aimed to present an accurate and
concise statement of the deaconess cause as it exists at
the present time.</p>

<p>In all cases where it was possible, original sources of
information have been consulted.</p>

<p>Many friends, both in Europe and America, have
given invaluable aid, for which words of thanks are an
inadequate recognition.</p>

<p>The excellent Index at the close of the volume was
kindly prepared by the Rev. J.&nbsp;C. Thomas.</p>

<p>Acknowledgments are also due to Mr. Gillett, Librarian
of the Union Theological Seminary, and to Mr.
C.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;A. Bjerregaard, of the Astor Library, for putting
not only the facilities of the library, but their personal
assistance, at the service of the writer.</p>

<h2 class="newchap">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="smc">How</span> far, and in what form, ought woman&#8217;s work
in the Church to be organized? What was the
deaconess of St. Paul&#8217;s epistles? What light on
this subject do the primitive and the medi&aelig;val
Churches yield us? Can &ldquo;sisterhoods&rdquo; be established
without weakening the sense of personal responsibility
in those Christian women who are not
thus wholly set apart to charitable and spiritual
work? Can they be multiplied without danger of
introducing into Protestant communions the evils
of the conventual life? Are there modern instances
of safe and successful organizations? What
good have they achieved, and what further good
do they promise? In what relation should such
organizations stand to the authority and fostering
care of the Church? What should be their scope,
spirit, methods? What regulations are fundamental<a
  id="png.010" name="png.010"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">010/</span>6</samp>
and indispensable? What perils are real
and possibly imminent?</p>

<p>To answer these, and other questions associated
with them, this book is written. Its authoress is a
gifted daughter of the Church, well known in literary
and educational circles. During a protracted
sojourn in Europe she enjoyed unusual facilities for
studying the deaconess work as carried on in many
places, and particularly in the institutions founded
by Pastor Fliedner at Kaiserswerth in Prussia, and
in those at Mildmay in England. She has also
made a thorough and discriminating study of the
subject as developed in the early centuries of the
Church and in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The book itself will amply reveal these facts,
and cannot but contribute largely to the guidance
of the newly revived interest of the American
churches in the far-reaching question how Christian
women may best serve their Lord in serving the
humanity which he has redeemed.</p>

<p>It appears at an opportune time. The General
Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, at
its session in May, 1888, inserted in the law of the
Church a chapter on deaconesses, defining their<a
  id="png.011" name="png.011"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">011/</span>7</samp>
duties and providing for the appointment and
oversight of them through the Annual Conferences.
This action was the natural outcome of a wide and
increasing appreciation of the service of Christian
women in many departments of Church work; and
it was greatly furthered by the advocacy of Dr. J.&nbsp;M.
Thoburn, now the devoted and honored missionary
bishop of India and Malaysia. But it had
not been the subject of any considerable previous
discussion in the periodicals of the Church, and
there was not in the Church a widely diffused or an
accurate knowledge of the history, scope, possibilities,
or perils of such an organization. The promptness,
however, with which the provision thus made
by the General Conference has been seized upon by
the Church in several of our large cities, indicates
that the time was ripe for the movement. But
information is still scanty; ideas concerning the
aim and place of the deaconess work are crude;
methods have been very little digested; the foundations
of local homes evidently may come to be
very imperfectly laid; and the movement may
easily come to naught.</p>

<p>This book, it is hoped, will do a twofold work.<a
  id="png.012" name="png.012"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">012/</span>8</samp>
It will awaken a lively interest in a movement
already arrived at large proportions in some parts
of European Protestantism; and it will guide those
among us who are studying how best to organize,
against the sin and suffering of the world, the practically
unlimited resources of Christian women.
Whenever any one shall in some good degree apprehend
what helpfulness for the lost as yet lies
undeveloped in the hearts and hands of the daughters
of the Church, and what honor may yet come
to Christianity by the rightly directed use of this
power, he will welcome a volume which, like the
present one, offers such guidance as history, observation,
and earnest reflection yield on the question
at issue.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h4>THE DIACONATE.</h4>


<p><span class="smc">In</span> the ruins of the old cities of Greece and Rome
we find buildings that were used for public purposes
of all kinds&mdash;forums, theaters, amphitheaters, circuses,
and temples of worship. Every provision
was made for the entertainment of the people, and
for their political and intellectual needs. But nowhere
do we find the ruins of structures, belonging
either to the public or to private individuals, indicating
that any attempt was ever made to care for
the feeble-minded, the insane, the deaf, the blind,
the sick, or the aged; those that in every nation
of modern times are the wards of the State and the
definite objects of religious ministrations.</p>

<p>The ruins cannot be found because such buildings
never existed. No provision was made for those
suffering from bodily infirmities, because so far as<a
  id="png.014" name="png.014"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">014/</span>10</samp>
the State could control circumstances they were
not allowed to exist. Children who were defective
in any way were put to death. In Sparta this
measure was carried out under government supervision.
Even Plato in his model republic has all
children of wicked men, the misshapen, or the illegitimate
put out of existence, that they may not
be a burden to the State.<sup><a href="#fn.i.1" name="fna.i.1" id="fna.i.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>With the coming of Christ new elements were
introduced into the civilization of the world; elements
of kindliness, of compassion, of sympathy of
man toward his fellow-man, that up to this time
had not been known. There was a new revelation
of the brotherhood of all men in the fatherhood of
God: &ldquo;We are all one in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This spirit of compassion and of sympathy has
grown with every century in the Christian era, and
at no time has it been stronger in the history of the
world than it is to-day. Well has one American
historian said:</p>

<div class="longquote">
<p>&ldquo;To a generation which knows but two crimes
worthy of death, that against the life of the individual
and that against the life of the State; which
has expended fabulous sums in the erection of reformatories,
asylums, and penitentiaries, houses of<a
  id="png.015" name="png.015"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">015/</span>11</samp>
correction, houses of refuge, and houses of detention
all over the land; which has furnished every
State prison with a library, with a hospital, with
workshops, and with schools, the brutal scenes on
which our ancestors looked with indifference seem
scarcely a reality. Yet it is well to recall them,
for we cannot but turn from the contemplation
of so much misery and so much suffering with a
deep sense of thankfulness that our lot has fallen
in a pitiful age, when more compassion is felt
for a galled horse or a dog run over at a street-crossing
than our great-grandfathers felt for a
woman beaten for cursing, or a man imprisoned for
debt.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.i.2" name="fna.i.2" id="fna.i.2">2</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p>The spirit of Christ has penetrated even where
his rule is not acknowledged, and the humanitarianism
of the present day is simply the leaven
of Christian love working among the masses of
men.</p>

<p>In the Christian world the effort to realize the
brotherhood of all men in Christ is producing large
results. Treasures of money, and infinitely more
precious treasures of men, are every year devoted
to this one object. The cause of Protestant foreign
missions is not yet a century old, but the
latest available statistics tell us that the following<a
  id="png.016" name="png.016"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">016/</span>12</samp>
sums are being contributed annually for this great
work:<sup><a href="#fn.i.3" name="fna.i.3" id="fna.i.3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>The subject of home missions is to-day attracting
greater attention than ever before. &ldquo;Die Innere
Mission&rdquo; of Germany, the various forms the work
assumes in England, the many societies in the
United States occupied by the questions of city
evangelization, work among the Mormons, the treatment
of the Indians, care for the colored race, and<a
  id="png.017" name="png.017"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">017/</span>13</samp>
other phases of home work show that Christians
are fully understanding that it is wise to build over
against our own house.</p>

<p>Certainly the reproach cannot justly be made
that the Church of Christ is neglectful of the precept,
&ldquo;As we have therefore opportunity, let us do
good unto all men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is genuine service of man to man, and the
motive of the service is love to God. Every revelation
of God is of ministering love and compassion,
and the efforts of his disciples to imitate the divine
love have indelibly stamped upon modern civilization
the Christian impress.</p>

<p>The service of ministering compassion is so
clearly one of the duties of Christ&#8217;s Church that of
necessity there must be ordinances touching the
exercise of this duty. So in Acts vi, 3, we read of
the appointment of the deacons, &ldquo;men of honest
report, full of the Holy Ghost and of wisdom,&rdquo; to
see that the service of the tables was not neglected.</p>

<p>But Christian women have ever had special gifts
in caring for the poor and sick and helpless, and
the women of apostolic times must necessarily have
had their part in these services of love. In addition
to the diaconate appointed by the apostles recorded
in the sixth chapter of Acts, we must look
for a female diaconate as an office in the Church.<a
  id="png.018" name="png.018"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">018/</span>14</samp>
This we do not fail to find. In Rom.&nbsp;xvi, 1, we
read: &ldquo;I commend unto you Phebe, a deacon of
the church which is at Cenchrea.&rdquo; Such at least
would have been the form of the verse if our translators
had rendered the Greek word here translated
servant as they rendered the like word in the sixth
chapter of Acts, the third of the First Epistle to
Timothy, and in other passages of the apostolic
writings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ye receive her in the Lord as becometh
saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever
business she hath need of you: for she hath
been a succorer of many, and of myself also.&rdquo;
These words of St. Paul are especially valuable
as an apostolic witness for the existence of the
office of deaconess at the time when he wrote.
They are even more than that. They are an apostolic
commendation of the office addressed to the
Christian Church of all times to accept the deaconess
in the Lord, and to assist her &ldquo;in whatsoever
business she hath need of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether Priscilla, spoken of with Aquila as &ldquo;my
helpers in Christ Jesus,&rdquo; or Tryphena, Tryphosa,
and the beloved Persis, who &ldquo;labored much,&rdquo; or
Julia and Olympas, all mentioned in the same
chapter, were or were not deaconesses we have
no means of knowing.</p>
<a id="png.019" name="png.019"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">019/</span>15</samp>

<p>Outside of this chapter we do not find other
references to the order in the New Testament,
unless it be in 1&nbsp;Tim. iii, 11. In the midst of a
lengthy description of the qualifications of deacons
is interjected the exhortation: &ldquo;Even so must
their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful
in all things.&rdquo; Now the word <i>wives</i> has no authority
from the Greek word, which is simply <i>women</i>.
Bishop Lightfoot remarks, in his book on the authorized
version of the New Testament, &ldquo;If the
theory of the definite article (in the Greek) had
been understood our translators would have seen
that the reference is to deaconesses, not to wives
of the deacons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many eminent scholars are of the same opinion,
among whom are Chrysostom, Grotius, Bishop
Wordsworth, and Dean Alvord. Dean Howson
adds: &ldquo;It should be particularly noticed in connection
with this that in the early part of the chapter
no such directions are given concerning the wives
of the bishops, though they are certainly as important
as the wives of the deacons; so that it can
scarcely be thought otherwise than that the apostle&#8217;s
directions were for the deaconesses, an order
which we find in ecclesiastical records for some
centuries side by side with that of deacons.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.i.4" name="fna.i.4" id="fna.i.4">4</a></sup></p>
<a id="png.020" name="png.020"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">020/</span>16</samp>

<p>Those mentioned in Tit. ii, 3, and in 1&nbsp;Tim. v, 9,
cannot be considered as holding the office of a deaconess.
They belong distinctively to the class of
widows, who held a position of honor in the Church.
St. Paul had clear conceptions of the administrative
needs of the Church, and it is not probable that
he would set apart to the service of deaconesses,
which had many difficult duties, those who were
already sixty years old.</p>

<p>The many names of faithful women mentioned
in his letters as helpers in the Church are important
witnesses for the great apostle&#8217;s appreciation
of woman&#8217;s co-operation in the work of the Church,
although his judgment was necessarily limited in
some directions by the influence of the times in
which he lived.</p>

<p>Let us examine the requirements for the diaconate
of the early Church. The word diaconate means
service; helpful service. We use the word to designate
service for the Church of Christ; service that
more particularly concerns itself with administering
the charities of the Church and performing its duties
of compassion and mercy. The men who were
selected for this office were to be men of &ldquo;honest
report.&rdquo; They must have led a blameless life.
Those who had repented of wrong-doing and reformed
their lives were excluded from the office,<a
  id="png.021" name="png.021"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">021/</span>17</samp>
because they had lost a good report &ldquo;of them
which are without.&rdquo; Pre-eminently they must be
men of spiritual experience, proven Christians,
&ldquo;full of the Holy Ghost and of wisdom.&rdquo; They
were also to have practical gifts that would make
them efficient and capable in the duties of every-day
life. 1&nbsp;Tim. iii,&nbsp;8.</p>

<p>These are some of the qualifications spoken of as
belonging to the diaconate, and are the same in
application to either sex. The woman deacon must,
however, besides possessing the above qualities, be
unmarried or a widow. The married woman has
her calling at home, and cannot combine with that
an official calling in the Church, although she may
be a valuable lay helper.</p>

<p>The field of labor of the women deacons of apostolic
times and of the present is essentially the
same. The conditions of society and of the Church,
however, are totally dissimilar. We must, therefore,
look to see new adaptations of the same useful
qualities. In other words, we shall not expect to take
the female diaconate of the days of the apostles
and transport it unchanged, into nineteenth century
environments. We shall rather expect to see
the invariably useful qualities of the diaconate of
women adapted to the needs of the sinful, sorrowing,
ignorant, and helpless of the age in which we live.</p>

<h3 class="newchap">CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h4>DEACONESSES IN THE EARLY CHURCH.</h4>


<p>To understand the position of the deaconess with
respect to the modern Church we must know something
of the relation in which she stood to the early
Church. Concisely as may be we must recall the
story of the intervening centuries to the present,
that we may learn the true position of deaconesses
in modern times.</p>

<p>We have very little knowledge of the early
Church. During the first century and the first
half of the second century continued persecution
compelled the religious communities of the new
faith to live in almost complete seclusion. For the
same reason little has been left on record of those
years, and it is impossible to form clear conceptions
of Church history during the period. The first
trace which we find of the existence of deaconesses
after the times of the apostles comes to us from an
entirely outside source&mdash;from the official records of
the Roman government. Shortly after the close of
the first century the Emperor Trajan sent the<a
  id="png.023" name="png.023"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">023/</span>19</samp>
younger Pliny as prefect to Bithynia in Asia Minor.
At the imperial command he began a persecution
of the Christians, but interrupted it for a time to
obtain further instructions from the emperor. His
letter and the reply still exist. In the course of
what he wrote Pliny says that he had sought to
learn from two maids, who were called &ldquo;ministr&aelig;&rdquo;
(&ldquo;ex duabus ancillis, qu&aelig; ministr&aelig; dicebantur,&rdquo;
Book&nbsp;x, chap. xcvii), or helpers, the truth of what
the Christians had said, and had even deemed it
necessary to put them to torture, but could obtain
evidence of nothing save unbounded superstition.
Here is independent testimony of singular interest
that deaconesses, followers of Phebe, were found in
Christian communities of Asia Minor at the beginning
of the second century, and that they kept the
faith, when put to cruel martyrdom.</p>

<p>The clearest conceptions of the characteristics
and duties of deaconesses of the early Church we
obtain from the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i>, a collection
of ecclesiastical instructions that gradually grew
up in the Eastern Church, and were gathered into
one work in the fourth century. These instructions
were of unequal antiquity, ranging from the earliest
usages to the rules and practices last determined
upon. Whether the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i> have
all the authority that some claim for them is a<a
  id="png.024" name="png.024"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">024/</span>20</samp>
question not here to be decided. If not genuine,
they must have been written at a very early time,
and from that fact possess a historical value of their
own. &ldquo;They prove beyond a doubt that there was
a time in the history of the Church when a clear
idea was held by some writer of the office of the
female deacon as essential to the discipline of the
Church.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.ii.1" name="fna.ii.1" id="fna.ii.1">1</a></sup> From them we learn of three distinct
types of women connected with the administration
of the Church&mdash;deaconesses, widows, and virgins.
Deaconesses and widows date from apostolic times,
the Church virgins from a somewhat later period.
The distinction between widows and deaconesses
was not at first clearly maintained. By some
Church fathers widows were called deaconesses,
and deaconesses widows. It was only after the
lapse of time that we find the classes clearly distinguished,
and when that time is reached the
deaconesses have become exalted in office, being
regarded as belonging to the clergy,<sup><a href="#fn.ii.2" name="fna.ii.2" id="fna.ii.2">2</a></sup> while the widows
have lost somewhat the honorable position first
accorded to them. The deaconesses are active ministering
agents, caring for the necessities of others;
the widows have passed the period of active service,<a
  id="png.025" name="png.025"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">025/</span>21</samp>
and having won the respect and protection of the
Church are supported in old age from a fund set
apart for that purpose. In the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i>
the order of deaconesses stands forth independently,
its many official activities are mentioned,
and the importance of its service emphasized.</p>

<p>By combining the different references we obtain
a tolerably clear picture of the deaconess and her
duties. She must be a &ldquo;pure virgin,&rdquo; or &ldquo;a widow
once married, faithful, and worthy&rdquo; (Book vi, chap.
xvii). Her special duties were as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) She was a door-keeper at the women&#8217;s entrance
to the church. This was an ancient service,
dating back to the oldest times.<sup><a href="#fn.ii.3" name="fna.ii.3" id="fna.ii.3">3</a></sup> Ignatius died a
martyr&#8217;s death not long after the beginning of the
second century, and in a letter which bears his
name is written, &ldquo;I greet the doorkeepers of the
holy doors, the deaconesses who are in the Lord.&rdquo;

This guardianship was maintained not only in
times of persecution, but as a matter of order and
discipline in times of peace.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) She showed women their places in the congregation,
being especially bound to look after the
poor and strangers, giving each due attention.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) She instructed the female catechumens. She<a
  id="png.026" name="png.026"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">026/</span>22</samp>
also visited the women&#8217;s apartments, where male deacons
could not enter, carried messages to the bishops,
and acted as a missionary. Teaching was an important
part of the duties of the early deaconesses.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) The deaconess had certain duties in connection
with the baptism of women that were considered
important and indispensable.</p>

<p>(<i>e.</i>) In times of persecution she visited those who
were oppressed or in prison, and ministered to their
bodily and spiritual needs. She seems to have been
less endangered in performing these acts than were
men. Lucian alludes to the service of these devoted
women in prisons. She also cared for the
sick and sorrowing, being especially &ldquo;zealous to
serve other women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(<i>f.</i>) On occasion she was a mediator when there
was strife in families, or among friends. Both to
deacons and deaconesses &ldquo;pertain messages, journeys
to foreign parts, ministrations, services.&rdquo; The
ever-to-be-remembered journey of Phebe to Rome,
when a whole system of theology was committed
to her keeping, was quite within the sphere of her
duties. It has also been said that to them was
given the safe-keeping of the holy books in periods
of persecution. The enumeration of these principal
duties implying so many lesser details helps us
to understand that &ldquo;deaconesses are needed for<a
  id="png.027" name="png.027"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">027/</span>23</samp>
many purposes&rdquo; (Book ii, chapter xv). The deaconess
was ordained to her work, as is attested by
a great number of authorities.<sup><a href="#fn.ii.4" name="fna.ii.4" id="fna.ii.4">4</a></sup> &ldquo;It was because
men felt still that the Holy Ghost alone could give
power to do any work to God&#8217;s glory that they
deemed themselves constrained to ask such power
of him, in setting a woman to do Church service.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.ii.5" name="fna.ii.5" id="fna.ii.5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The following beautiful prayer of ordination, attributed
to the apostle Bartholomew, bears within
it certain proofs of the very early existence of the
ceremony, as well as of the order of deaconesses:</p>

<div class="longquote">
<p>&ldquo;Eternal God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Creator of man and women, who didst fill Miriam
and Deborah and Hannah and Huldah with thy
Spirit, and didst not disdain to suffer thine only-begotten
Son to be born of a woman; who also in
the tabernacle and temple didst appoint woman-keepers
of thine holy gates, look down now upon this
thine handmaid, who is designated to the office of
deaconess, and cleanse her from all filthiness of the
flesh and of the spirit, that she may worthily execute
the work intrusted to her to thine honor, and
to the praise of thine Anointed, to whom, with thee<a
  id="png.028" name="png.028"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">028/</span>24</samp>
and the Holy Ghost, be honor and adoration forever.
Amen.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The allusion to the creation of man and woman,
to the women in the Old Testament who were
called to special service, as well as to Mary, the
mother of the Lord, while no reference is made to
the women of the apostolic Church who were so
highly commended, and held in veneration as
worthy of all imitation, go to prove that the origin
of this prayer was so near the time of the apostles
as to be almost contemporary with them.</p>

<p>The office of the deaconess, as described by the
<i>Apostolic Constitutions</i>, fitted into the needs of the
Eastern Church and the requirements of Greek life.
It was in the East that the diaconate of women originated,
and here that it attained its greatest growth.
In the West custom did not demand the careful
separation of the sexes as in the East, and church
relations were less bound by social usages; consequently
we meet with fewer references to deaconesses
in the works of the Latin fathers, and the
diaconate of women is not so deeply rooted in the
affections of the church communities as we have
found it in the Greek Church.<sup><a href="#fn.ii.6" name="fna.ii.6" id="fna.ii.6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>The fourth century was the blossoming period of<a
  id="png.029" name="png.029"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">029/</span>25</samp>
woman&#8217;s diaconate, when it attained its highest importance.
All the leading Greek fathers and Church
authorities of the age make mention of it. The
office is spoken of as worthy of all honor, filled by
women of rank from noble families, and those of
wealth and ability. It found its special advocate
and protector in Chrysostom, &ldquo;John of the Golden
Mouth,&rdquo; who was Bishop of Constantinople from
397 until 407&nbsp;A.D. He seems to have had the
ability, rare for that age, of understanding the value
of the services of Christian women, and through his
wise guidance and encouragement had over them
almost unbounded influence. Forty-six deaconesses
were under his direction&mdash;forty attached to
the mother church at Constantinople, and six belonging
to a small church in the suburbs. A number
of these were closely identified with his history,
either as relatives or friends, and through his writings
their memory is preserved. Of these are
Nicarete, of a noble family of Nicomedia. We are
told she was of a modest, retiring nature, and
would not take places of responsibility when urged
to do so by Chrysostom. We note a strong tendency
toward the later celibate life of the nuns
when we read that she was extolled for &ldquo;her perpetual
virginity and holy life.&rdquo; Sabiniana was the
aunt of Chrysostom. To Amprucla the bishop<a
  id="png.030" name="png.030"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">030/</span>26</samp>
wrote two letters still extant.<sup><a href="#fn.ii.7" name="fna.ii.7" id="fna.ii.7">7</a></sup> They are filled
with words of consolation for the religious persecution
she has undergone. In one of them he says:
&ldquo;Greatly did we sympathize with your manliness,
your steadfast and adamantine understanding, your
freedom of speech and boldness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Manliness of
soul&rdquo; seems to have held a high place in the bishop&#8217;s
favorite qualities. In another place, writing
to the same deaconess, he praises &ldquo;your steadfast
soul, true to God; yea, rather, your noble and most
manly soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pentadia and Procla were closely associated with
Olympias. In a letter to Pentadia, Chrysostom
writes: &ldquo;For I know your great and lofty soul,
which can sail as with a fair wind through many
tempests, and in the midst of the waves enjoy a
white calm.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.ii.8" name="fna.ii.8" id="fna.ii.8">8</a></sup> Reading such words of appreciation,
words that in other places approach dangerously
near to adulation, we better understand the
influence Chrysostom exercised over the women
of his time, and their steadfast devotion to him.
They had the conviction that all their efforts met
with his sincere and profound appreciation and
quick responsive acknowledgment.</p>
<a id="png.031" name="png.031"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">031/</span>27</samp>

<p>Pre-eminent among the friends of the great bishop
was Olympias, of whom Dean Howson said, &ldquo;She
is the queenly figure among the deaconesses of the
primitive Church.&rdquo; To understand her life we
must recall the scenes by which she was surrounded
and the age in which she lived.<sup><a href="#fn.ii.9" name="fna.ii.9" id="fna.ii.9">9</a></sup></p>

<p>In the great capital of the Eastern Empire, where
the luxuriance and magnificence of the Orient combined
with the keen, quick intellectual life of the
Greeks; in the circle of the imperial court, with its
intrigues, its fashions, its favoritisms; at a time
when outwardly much respect was paid to the
forms of religious life, but when the great and vital
dogmas of the Church were made the sport of witty
sophistical disputations; when those who endeavored
to lead an earnest Christian life met with
nearly as much to oppose them as in periods of active
persecution; such were her environments.
They were little favorable to the strength of mind,
the fixedness of purpose, the self-denial and Christian
devotion that marked this noble deaconess.
Born in 368&nbsp;A.D. of a heathen family of rank, owing
to her parents&#8217; early death she was educated a Christian.
In her seventeenth year she married Nebridius,
the prefect of the city, but after a married life
of twenty months he died, leaving her at eighteen<a
  id="png.032" name="png.032"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">032/</span>28</samp>
years a widow, rich, beautiful, and free to decide
her future. The Emperor Theodosius desired her
to marry one of his kinsmen, but she refused, saying,
&ldquo;Had God designed me to lead a married life
he would not have taken my husband; I will remain
a widow,&rdquo; and shortly after she was consecrated a
deaconess by Bishop Nectarius. The emperor, angered
at her refusal, took from her the use of her
large fortune, and put it under the care of guardians
until she should be thirty years old, whereupon
she only thanked him for relieving her of the heavy
responsibility of administering her estate, and begged
him to add to his kindness by dividing it between
the poor and the Church.</p>

<p>Shamed out of his anger, the emperor soon restored
her rights, and when Chrysostom came to Constantinople
her lavish and often unwise generosity was
felt in every direction, being compared to &ldquo;a stream
which flows to the end of the world.&rdquo; He reproved
her unbounded liberality, and advised her to administer
alms as a wise steward who must render
an account. This counsel guided her into safer
paths. Finally, when Chrysostom was driven forth
to banishment, by his advice she remained in the
city, and became a support for his followers and
those who had been dependent upon him. She
met contemptuous treatment and judicial persecutions,<a
  id="png.033" name="png.033"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">033/</span>29</samp>
but continued her works of charity, and outlived
the man whose mind and heart had so influenced
hers by eleven years. Chrysostom wrote
her many letters, of which seventeen are extant.<sup><a href="#fn.ii.10" name="fna.ii.10" id="fna.ii.10">10</a></sup>
They plainly show the estimate he set upon the
diaconate of women, and his endeavor to wisely
cherish it. Unfortunately, they also show exaggeration
of compliment and praise which detract
from his words of sincere and honest admiration.
Too often, also, he gives undue value to works of
mercy, and exalts acts of ascetic self-denial.</p>

<p>The question of the age at which deaconesses
could be received is a vexed one. The confusion
of apprehension touching deaconesses and widows
led to differing enactments at different times and
places. The restriction of age, however, must
now have lost its force, as we find Olympias a
deaconess when not yet twenty years of age, and
Makrina, the sister of Gregory of Nyssa, was ordained
when a young girl. Deaconesses retained
control of their property. In truth, a law of the
State forbade them to enrich churches and institutions
at the expense of those having just claims on
them. Deaconesses also existed in the Church of
Asia Minor. Ignatius mentions them as at Antioch
in Syria. They were in Italy and Rome. The<a
  id="png.034" name="png.034"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">034/</span>30</samp>
Church of St. Pudentiana, in the Eternal City, keeps
alive the memory of two deaconesses whose house
is said to have stood on this site; Praxedes and Pudentiana,
the daughters of a Roman senator, who
devoted themselves, with all they had, to the service
of the Church. Deaconesses also penetrated to Ireland,
Gaul, and Spain, lingering in the last named
country many years after they had passed out of
knowledge elsewhere.</p>

<p>We find very little about this order of Christian
workers in the Western Church. There is a passage
of Origen in a Latin translation which speaks of the
ministry of women as both existing and necessary,
but in the great Latin fathers, the contemporaries
of Chrysostom, scarcely a mention occurs. From
the last half of the fifth century the diaconate of
women declined in importance.<sup><a href="#fn.ii.11" name="fna.ii.11" id="fna.ii.11">11</a></sup> It was deprived
of its clerical character by the decrees passed by
the Gallic councils of the fifth and sixth centuries.
It was finally entirely abolished as a church order
by the Synod of Orleans, 593&nbsp;A.D., which forbade
any woman henceforth to receive the <i>benedictio diaconalis</i>,
which had been substituted for <i>ordinatio
diaconalis</i> by a previous council (Synod of Orange,
441). The withdrawing of church sanctions made
the deaconess cause a private one. But as such it<a
  id="png.035" name="png.035"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">035/</span>31</samp>
existed for hundreds of years, often under the
patronage and protection of those high in authority.
About the year 600&nbsp;A.D. the patriarch of
Constantinople, godfather of the Emperor Mauritius,
built for his sister, who was a deaconess, a
church which for centuries was called the &ldquo;Church
of the Deaconesses.&rdquo; It is still standing and,
only slightly changed, is now used for a Turkish
mosque.<sup><a href="#fn.ii.12" name="fna.ii.12" id="fna.ii.12">12</a></sup></p>

<p>In the twelfth century there were still deaconesses
at Constantinople. Balsamon, a distinguished
professor of Church law, writing at the time, says
that deaconesses were still elected in that city and
took charge of conferences among women members,
but in other places the order had passed completely
away.</p>

<p>There was no historian of the diaconate of the
early Church. We learn of it only from isolated
and occasional references in works devoted to other
subjects. Yet these references are sufficient to
enable us to affirm that deaconesses were a factor
in the life of the Church for from nine to twelve
centuries, or two thirds of the Christian era.</p>

<p>The same influences led to its decay that affected
the entire life of the Church during these centuries.<a
  id="png.036" name="png.036"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">036/</span>32</samp>
The superior sanctity attached to the unmarried
state, that brought about the celibacy of the priests,
gradually changed the active beneficent existence
of the old-time deaconesses into the cloistral life of
nuns. Statutes were passed forbidding her to marry.
Gradually grew up the dangerous superstition of the
marriage of the individual soul with Christ, that
made of the nun the Bride of Christ in an especial
sense. It was this false conception that led the vow
of the nun to be regarded as the vow of marriage,
and to be guarded from infringement in the same
way as the human marriage tie, and like it to be
lasting for life. The glorious doctrine of justification
by faith was replaced by ascetic mortifications
of the flesh based upon the belief in meritorious
works. The cell of the monk and the nun were
esteemed more sacred than the family circle, and
in the darkness of medi&aelig;val times that settled
down upon the life of the Church we lose sight
of the busy, active ministrations of women deacons,
who had once been esteemed so needful to her
usefulness.</p>

<p>There are other minor causes that aided in the
downfall of the order; the abuses that arose in
some cases; the changes in the ceremony of baptism
by which the aid of women was not so indispensable,
and especially the fact that since the time<a
  id="png.037" name="png.037"></a><samp class="pgmark"
 ><span class="png">037/</span>33</samp>
of Constantine the care of the sick and poor was
placed under the charge of the State.<sup><a href="#fn.ii.13" name="fna.ii.13" id="fna.ii.13">13</a></sup></p>

<p>These causes combined removed from the life of
the Church a powerful agency for good, and for
centuries deprived it of the pre-eminent gifts of
ministration which belong to Christian women.</p>

<h3 class="newchap">CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h4>DEACONESSES FROM THE TWELFTH TO THE NINETEENTH
CENTURIES.</h4>


<p><span class="smc">During</span> these seven centuries whenever there
arose a reviving spirit of true love to God, whether
within the Church of Rome or in any of the churches
formed from reforming elements that separated from
it, then we find traces of the diaconate of woman assuming
some form of devotion to Christ and work
for him. One of these movements well worth our
study originated in Belgium while the last of the
Greek deaconesses were still daily walking the
arched pathway that led to their church in Constantinople.
Toward the close of the twelfth century
great corruption of morals and open abuses
prevailed in society, and also in the Church. One
of those who protested against the evils of the
times was the priest Lambert le Bègue, as he was
called, meaning the stutterer. He lived at Liège,
in Belgium, and just without the city walls owned a
large garden. He determined to make use of this
to found a retreat for godly women, where they<a
  id="png.039" name="png.039"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">039/</span>35</samp>
could lead in common a life of well-doing. Here
he built a number of little houses, and in the center
a church, which was dedicated to St. Christopher
in 1184. Then he presented the whole to some
godly women to be used and owned in common.
His earnest words of rebuke brought persecution
upon him from those whose consciences he disturbed,
but he went to Rome and appealed to the
pope, who not only protected him from his assailants,
but made him the patriarch of the order he
had founded. Only six months after his return,
however, he died, and was buried before the
high altar of the church he had erected in 1187.
Whether he was indeed the founder of the Béguine
houses has been called in question. Be that as it
may, fifty years after his death fifteen hundred Béguines
were living around St. Christopher&#8217;s Church,<sup><a href="#fn.iii.1" name="fna.iii.1" id="fna.iii.1">1</a></sup>
and Béguine courts were found throughout Belgium,
in the Netherlands, south along the Rhine,
in eastern France, and in Switzerland. The Crusades
made many widows, and both widows and young
girls sought shelter in the community life of the
Béguines. As a rule they lived alone, in separate
small houses built closely together and surrounded
by a wall. Each house bore on its door the sign
of the cross, and with every Béguine court there<a
  id="png.040" name="png.040"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">040/</span>36</samp>
were invariably two large buildings&mdash;a church and a
hospital; the one for the worship of the sisters,
the other the field of their self-denying ministrations.
At first they were in no wise distinguished
in their dress from other women, but in time they
wore a habit which varied in color with each establishment,
but was generally blue, gray, or brown.
The veil was invariably white. The sisters had to
earn, or partly earn, their own livelihood. In the
time remaining they rendered essential service in
performing acts of charity. They received orphans
to bring up and educate, taught little children,
nursed the sick, performed the last offices for
the dead, and bound themselves by good deeds
closely with the lives of the people. They were
in no sense isolated from the world, but lived
busy, useful lives in the midst of the world. They
could leave the community at any time, and after
severing their connection with it were free to
marry. They also retained control of their own
property.</p>

<p>There were certainly many points of resemblance
between these women who were so active in the
sphere of Christian charity in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries and the deaconesses of Europe
to-day. The most prosperous period for the
Béguines was the first half of the thirteenth<a
  id="png.041" name="png.041"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">041/</span>37</samp>
century, when they were numbered by thousands.<sup><a href="#fn.iii.2" name="fna.iii.2" id="fna.iii.2">2</a></sup>
Gradually persecution was directed against them.
The nuns looked upon them with disfavor, and the
pope withdrew his protection. In the Netherlands
many became Protestants at the time of the Reformation,
but the Béguines of to-day, changed in many
respects from the original type, and now, closely
resembling the other sisterhoods of Catholicism, are
frequently to be seen in the cities of Belgium and
north-eastern France.</p>

<p>A new current of spiritual life swept over the
church in the fourteenth century, and again we
find women living together in community life, and
devoting themselves to common service in good
deeds, and known as the Sisters of the Common
Life. There was also a Brotherhood of the Common
Life, as there were Beghards, communities of Christian
men corresponding to the Béguines. The
Brotherhood and the Sisterhood of the Common
Life honored as their founder Gerhard Groot, of
Deventer, who was born in 1340. Of a singularly
attractive personality, a creative mind, and an<a
  id="png.042" name="png.042"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">042/</span>38</samp>
ardent, enthusiastic nature, he was born to influence
and command. He was already known as a
priest of eloquence and wide learning when, in 1374,
he met with a deep spiritual change, and from that
year dated his conversion. Henceforth, with every
power of a rarely gifted nature, he sought to lead
those who heard him to lives of purity and holiness.
Gradually there grew up about him a circle of like-minded
friends, occupied in writing books to spread
his ideas, and aiding him as they could. His friend
Florentius proposed that they live together and
form a community. &ldquo;A community!&rdquo; answered
Groot. &ldquo;The begging orders will never permit
that.&rdquo; But Florentius, the planner and organizer,
persisted, offering his own house as a home, and
held to the advantages of his plan until Groot
yielded, and said, &ldquo;In the name of the Lord begin
your work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such was the origin of the Brotherhood of the
Common Life, and from its circle proceeded that
immortal book, the <i>Imitation of Christ</i>, by Thomas
à Kempis, keeping alive in the hearts of choice
spirits of every generation the thoughts and sentiments
of the men of whom its author was the interpreter.
For a community of women of similar
aims and purposes it needed only that Groot should
make a few changes in the house that he had already<a
  id="png.043" name="png.043"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">043/</span>39</samp>
set apart from his paternal inheritance as a
home for destitute women, and the first sister house
began. Like the Béguines, the Sisters of the Common
Life took no obligations binding them to life-long
service, but they differed from them in living
more closely together in one family, and had a
common purse. They wore a gray costume, and
also worked for their own support. The special
virtues they inculcated were obedience to those
above them in authority, humility that would not
shun the meanest task, and friendliness to all.
Their charitable duties were much the same as the
Béguines; they cared for children, nursed the sick,
and often acted as midwives. In the first half of
the sixteenth century there were at least eighty-seven
sister-houses, mostly in the Netherlands.<sup><a href="#fn.iii.3" name="fna.iii.3" id="fna.iii.3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>It will be noticed that these freer communities of
religious women, that bear so much closer resemblance
to the deaconesses of the early Church than
to the sisterhoods of nuns contemporary with them,
mostly existed in the great free cities of Germany
and the Netherlands, which were the cradles of political
and religious liberty, the centers of commerce
and of civilization at that time.</p>

<p>Among the Waldenses, the Poor Men of Lyons,
who were already prominent in the last half of the<a
  id="png.044" name="png.044"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">044/</span>40</samp>
twelfth century, we find there were deaconesses.
We learn of them again, too, among the Bohemian
brethren, the followers of Huss. With deep Christian
faith they endeavored to form a Church after
the apostolic model, and in 1457 appointed Church
deaconesses. &ldquo;They were to form a female council
of elder women, who were to counsel and care
for the married women, widows, and young girls, to
make peace between quarrelers, to prevent slandering,
and to preserve purity and good morals,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.4" name="fna.iii.4" id="fna.iii.4">4</a></sup> aims
which keep close to the apostolic definition of this
office.</p>

<p>Luther, the great master-mind of the Reformation,
was too clear-sighted to fail to appreciate the
importance of women for the service of the Church.
Speaking of the quality which is an inherent part
of the diaconate of women, he says: &ldquo;Women who
are truly pious are wont to have especial grace in
comforting others and lessening their sorrows.&rdquo; In
his exposition of 1&nbsp;Pet. ii, 5, he uttered truly remarkable
words, for the age in which he lived, concerning
women as members of the holy priesthood.
He says: &ldquo;Now, wilt thou say, Is that true that
we are all priests, and should preach? Where will
that lead us? Shall there be no difference in
persons? shall women also be priests? Answer.<a
  id="png.045" name="png.045"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">045/</span>41</samp>
If thou desirest to behold Christians, so must
thou see no differences, and must not say, That is
a man or a woman, that is a servant or a lord, old
or young. They are all one, simply Christian people.
Therefore are they all priests. They may all
publish God&#8217;s word, save that women shall not
speak in the church, but shall let men preach.
But where there are no men, but women only, as
in the nuns&#8217; cloisters, there might a woman be
chosen who should preach to them. This is the
true priesthood, in which are the three elements
of spiritual offerings, prayer, and preaching for the
Church. <i>Whoever does this is a priest. You are
all bound to preach the Word, to pray for the Church,
and to offer yourself to God.</i>&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.5" name="fna.iii.5" id="fna.iii.5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>There is no mention in Luther&#8217;s writings, however,
of the diaconate of women. It would be
more natural that he should have tried to adjust
the lives of the monks and nuns as he knew of
them to the new relations arising from the Reformation
rather than to bring to life an office of which he
had no personal knowledge. This was what he did
when he wrote to the burghers of Herford in Westphalia.
In their new zeal they wanted to drive the
inmates from the religious houses, although the
latter had been the means of teaching them the<a
  id="png.046" name="png.046"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">046/</span>42</samp>
reformed doctrines. In his letter of January 31, 1532,
Luther says: &ldquo;If the brothers and sisters who are
by you truly teach and hold the true word it is my
friendly wish that you will not allow them to be
disturbed or experience bitterness in this matter.
Let them retain their religious dress and their accustomed
habits which are not opposed to the
Gospel.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.6" name="fna.iii.6" id="fna.iii.6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Certainly Luther would have seen no harm in
allowing deaconesses the protection of a special
garb.</p>

<p>Passing to another great reformer, Calvin, we
find not only references to deaconesses as filling
a &ldquo;most honorable and most holy function in the
Church,&rdquo; but in the Church ordinances of Geneva,
which were drawn up by him, there is mention of the
diaconate as one of the four ordinances indispensable
to the organization of the Church.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands several attempts were made
to revive the ancient office. The General Synod of
the Reformed Church at Wesel, in 1568, first considered
the question. A later synod, in 1579, expressly
occupied itself with the work and office of
the deaconess, but the measures taken were not
adapted to advance the interests of the cause, and
it was formally abandoned by the Synod of Middleburg<a
  id="png.047" name="png.047"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">047/</span>43</samp>
in 1581. In the city of Wesel, however,
there continued to be deaconesses attached to the
city churches until 1610. In Amsterdam local
churches preserved the office still later than at
Wesel. Already in 1566 we read that in the great
reformed Church not only deacons but deaconesses
were elected. The terrible days of the Spanish
fury swept away all Church organization for a time,
but when it was restored in 1578 both classes of
Christian officers again resumed their duties. From
1582 lists of deaconesses were kept, showing at first
three; later, in 1704, twenty-eight, and in 1800 only
eight. At the present time there are women directors
of hospitals and orphanages in Amsterdam
who are called by the title of deaconesses. The
helpless, sick, and neglected children are now gathered
in institutions instead of being cared for individually
as was formerly the custom, and women
having positions of control in these institutions
are designated by the name formerly applied to
those who had the personal care of the same needy
classes.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that there was one association
of women in the century of the Reformation
that bears close resemblance to the Béguines
and the Sisters of the Common Life. These were
the Damsels of Charity, established by Prince<a
  id="png.048" name="png.048"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">048/</span>44</samp>
Henry Robert de la Mark, the sovereign prince of
Sédan in the Netherlands. In 1559 he, together
with the great majority of his subjects, embraced
the doctrines of the Reformed Church, and instead
of incorporating former church property with his
own possessions, as did so many princes of the Reformation,
he devoted it to founding institutions of
learning and of charity. These latter he put under
the care of the &ldquo;Damsels of Charity,&rdquo; an association
of women which he had instituted. The members
could live in their own homes or in the establishments,
but in either case they devoted themselves
to the protection and succor of the poor and sick and
the aged. While taking no vows, they were chosen
from those not bound by the marriage vow, and
were subject only to certain rules of living. The
Damsels of Charity have been held by some to be
the first Protestant association of deaconesses, although
not called by the name.<sup><a href="#fn.iii.7" name="fna.iii.7" id="fna.iii.7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>There are two evangelical societies, small in numbers,
but one at least powerful in influence, which
have retained deaconesses from their origin to the
present time. These are the Mennonites or Anabaptists,
and the Moravians. It was among the
Mennonites in Holland that Fliedner saw the<a
  id="png.049" name="png.049"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">049/</span>45</samp>
deaconesses, who so interested him in their duties that
he obtained the convictions which in the end led
him to devote his life to their restoration in the
economy of the Church. Among the Moravians,
deaconesses were introduced at the instance of Count
Zinzendorf in 1745, but only as a limited form of
woman&#8217;s service, by no means measuring up to the
place accorded them to day in Germany.</p>

<p>We have now reached the nineteenth century,
and from the early Church to the present time we
find successive if sporadic attempts to incorporate
into the Church the active diaconate of women.
These constantly recurring efforts imply a consciousness,
deep, if unexpressed, of the need to utilize better
the especial gifts of women in Christian service.
We have reached the moment when this consciousness
is to take a suitable and enduring form; when
the Church machinery, long defective in this particular,
is to be re-adjusted and made complete.</p>

<h3 class="newchap">CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h4>FLIEDNER, THE RESTORER OF THE OFFICE OF
DEACONESS.</h4>


<p><span class="smc">The</span> first years of the present century were sad
years for Germany. There was a life-and-death
struggle with an all-powerful conqueror to preserve
existence as a nation. The Germans still call this
&ldquo;the war for freedom.&rdquo; Immediately thereafter
followed a period of religious awakening, and this
proved to be the hour when the diaconate of woman
rose again to life and power. When the fullness
of time arrives for a cause or a movement to take
its place among the forces of society, many hearts
become impressed with its importance. So, between
the years 1820 and 1835, there were four several
attempts to awaken the Christian Church to an enlightened
conscience in this matter, the last of which
obtained a wide and an enduring success. The
first was made by Johann Adolph Franz Klönne,
pastor of the church at Bislich, near Wesel.
Stirred to admiration by the activity that the
women&#8217;s societies had shown in the Napoleonic<a
  id="png.051" name="png.051"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">051/</span>47</samp>
wars, he lamented the fact that the associations had
dissolved, and complained that they had not taken
a permanent form, in which the members might
have performed the duties for the Church that deaconesses
had done in the early years of Christianity.
In 1820 he published a pamphlet entitled <i>The
Revival of the Deaconesses of the Primitive Church
in our Women&#8217;s Associations</i>. This he sent to
many persons of influence, trying to win their co-operation
for the cause. He received a great many
answers in reply, among them one from the Crown
Princess Marianne. But while in a general way
his project met with approval, no one could suggest
a practical method by which his thought could be
realized.</p>

<p>A distinguished woman, Amalie Sieveking, attempted
the same task of utilizing the labor of Christian
women as deaconesses in the Church. She belonged
to a well-known patrician family in the old
free city of Hamburg, and was well known for her
philanthropic views and her generous deeds. &ldquo;When
I was eighteen years old,&rdquo; she relates, &ldquo;I first
learned about the charitable sisterhoods in Catholic
lands, and the knowledge seized upon me with almost
irresistible power. Like a lightning&#8217;s flash
came the thought, What if you were appointed
to found a similar institution for our Protestant<a
  id="png.052" name="png.052"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">052/</span>48</samp>
Church?&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iv.1" name="fna.iv.1" id="fna.iv.1">1</a></sup> The thought stayed by her, and disposed
her to receive willingly a similar suggestion
coming from the great Prussian minister Von
Stein, the Bismarck of Germany during the first
quarter of this century. He had been favorably
impressed by what he had seen of the Sisters of
Mercy in the camp and in hospitals. He consulted
with one of his councilors about increasing their
number, so that they could be employed in all the
Hospitals, Insane Asylums, and Penitentiaries which
had women inmates. To another minister he complained
with warmth that the Protestant Church had
no such sisterhoods by which the beneficent stream
of activities among women could be directed into
well-regulated channels. &ldquo;The religious life of
Protestantism suffers from the want of them,&rdquo; he
said. These words were repeated to Amalie Sieveking
and stirred her to make the endeavor to fulfill
her own long-cherished wishes, which were those of
Stein. Just at this time, in 1831, the cholera broke
out in her native city. She took this as a providential
opening, by means of which deaconesses could begin
their work, and went at once to one of the cholera
hospitals, offered her services as a nurse, and at the
same time issued an appeal for sister-women to<a
  id="png.053" name="png.053"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">053/</span>51</samp>
join her. But no one came. The only outcome of
her effort was a woman&#8217;s society which she formed
to care for the sick and the poor of her native city,
and to work for this she devoted the remainder of
her life. Stein and Amalie Sieveking had in mind
an order of women closely resembling the Sisters
of Charity. That their efforts were not crowned
with success seemed to the evangelical Protestant
promoters of the deaconess cause in later times
providential.<sup><a href="#fn.iv.2" name="fna.iv.2" id="fna.iv.2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Shortly after, in 1835, Count von der Recke, already
well known as the founder of two charitable
institutions, issued the first number of a magazine
called <i>Deaconesses; or, The Life and Labors of
Women Workers of the Church in Instruction, Education,
and the Care of the Sick</i>. Only a single number
appeared, but his earnest plea for deaconesses,
and the elaborate plan he devised for an institution
and officers, aroused wide attention, and brought
him a letter of warm commendation from the crown
prince, afterward King Frederick William IV. Evidently
the idea was ripening, and a near fruition
could be anticipated. But neither to minister of
state, count, nor prince&mdash;to no one among the distinguished
of the earth&mdash;was the honor given of<a
  id="png.054" name="png.054"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">054/</span>50</samp>
reviving the female diaconate. It was to a humble
pastor of an obscure village church that this work
was committed.</p>

<p>The little village of Eppstein lies in a beautiful
country, full of high mountains and deep-lying valleys,
about a dozen miles from Wiesbaden. At the
village parsonage of the little hamlet was born,
January 21, 1800, a son, the fourth of a family that
numbered twelve children. The pastor, whose
father before him had filled a like office, was a
favorite among his people for his pleasant speech,
sound advice about every-day matters, and his
faithfulness in instructing the children in the Bible
and the catechism, and caring for the sick and the
afflicted.</p>

<p>The little boy proved to be a strong, healthy
child, and as he grew older developed a liking for
books. His father taught a class composed of his
children and some boys in the neighborhood, and
when Theodor became old enough to join it he
soon outstripped the rest, giving his father no
little pride by his fluent rendering of Homer.
Theodor Fliedner was not quite fourteen years
old when the sudden death of the father changed
the whole life of the family, and left the mother
with eleven children to maintain and educate.
Now began for Fliedner a struggle to complete his<a
  id="png.055" name="png.055"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">055/</span>51</samp>
education. The simple, kindly hospitality that had
been so generously exercised in the village parsonage
met its reward. Friends came forward to offer help,
and at the beginning of the New Year Fliedner and
his brother went to the gymnasium at Idstein.
Here he was obliged to live sparingly, and earned
his bread by teaching, but he was happy and contented,
and found in study his great delight. He
was fond of reading books of travel and the lives of
great men, which stirred him to emulation. In
1817 he went to the University of Giessen. Here
he kept aloof from the political agitations among
the students. Neither was he affected by the rationalistic
teachings of the professors. His shy,
retired nature aided him in this course, and his
leisure hours were passed in reading the writings of
the Reformers. The jubilee festival of the Reformation
occurred in 1817, and the lives of the heroes of
the faith were brought freshly home to him.
Their strength of faith shamed him, but he had not
yet learned the secret of their power. He was yet
without a deep, spiritual life. From Giessen he
went to Göttingen, where he devoted himself to a
year&#8217;s study of history, philosophy, and theology.
During the holidays, as is the custom with German
students, he made repeated pedestrian tours. In
this way he visited the great free cities of the north,<a
  id="png.056" name="png.056"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">056/</span>52</samp>
Bremen, Hamburg, and Lubeck. From Göttingen
he and his brother went to the theological
seminary at Herborn, where the following summer
he passed with credit his theological examination.
He was now ready to enter God&#8217;s great school of practical
life to be further fitted for the mission he was
to accomplish. In September he went to Cologne
and was employed in the house of a wealthy merchant
as a private tutor. This was a great change
for the quiet youth of country habits. He took
great pains to accommodate himself to his surroundings,
and to acquire the truly Christian art of
becoming all things to all men. In after life, when
speaking of this period and its usefulness to him, he
wrote: &ldquo;It is a great hinderance to a man, even
to his progress in the kingdom of God, not to have
been brought up in gentle and refined manners
from his childhood.&rdquo; Although a faithful and
devoted teacher his life-work was not forgotten.
He constantly sought to widen his knowledge and
experience, was made assistant secretary of the
local Bible society, and formed friendships which
led to his appointment to the pastorate at Kaiserswerth.
This was a Catholic town formerly of some
importance. The ruins of an imperial palatinate are
still to be seen there, but in Fliedner&#8217;s time it
had become a little village of workmen dependent<a
  id="png.057" name="png.057"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">057/</span>53</samp>
on a few manufacturers. On January 18, 1822,
alone, and on foot, to save his poor society the
expense of his journey, Fliedner entered the town
where his life was henceforth to be centered. He
was to share the parsonage with the widow of
a previous pastor, and his sister was to be his
housekeeper. His income was one hundred and
thirty-five dollars a year. Only a month after
his arrival the great firm of velvet manufacturers
who provided the work-people with employment
failed, and the little church community seemed
about to be dispersed. The government offered
him another and better appointment, but he
felt that he must be a true shepherd, and not a
hireling, and would not leave his people. He
decided to make a journey to collect money to
form a permanent endowment for his church. A
journey over sixty years ago, to a young German
of quiet habits, was a very different matter from a
similar trip taken in this day of railroads and steamboats.
To Fliedner it seemed a very important matter;
and so it was in its results, which reached far
beyond the little congregation he served. With
great hesitation he began at Elberfeld, a town near
at hand. A pastor of the city, to encourage him,
accompanied him to friends, and on parting gave
him a friendly suggestion that, in addition to trust<a
  id="png.058" name="png.058"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">058/</span>54</samp>
in God, such work required &ldquo;patience, impudence,
and a ready tongue.&rdquo; Before starting on the longer
journey to Holland and England he returned
to his congregation and encouraged them by the
sum of nine hundred dollars that he had so far
secured. He was now absent for nine months, and
during that time obtained an amount sufficient to
put the little church in a position where a certain,
if modest, annual allowance was assured. The pastor
had also, in serving others, greatly strengthened
and broadened his own faith. As he says, &ldquo;In
both these Protestant countries I became acquainted
with a multitude of charitable institutions
for the benefit both of body and soul. I
saw schools and other educational organizations,
alms-houses, orphanages, hospitals, prisons, and
societies for the reformation of prisoners, Bible and
missionary societies, etc., and at the same time I
observed that it was a living faith in Christ which
had called almost every one of these institutions and
societies into life, and still preserved them in activity.
This evidence of the practical power, and fertility
of such a principle had a most powerful influence
in strengthening my own faith, as yet weak.&rdquo;
It was while in Holland that he wrote to Klönne
concerning the deaconesses, whose duties he had
observed among the Mennonites. After his return<a
  id="png.059" name="png.059"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">059/</span>55</samp>
he applied himself with zeal and success to his pastoral
duties. Work was a delight to him, and his
energy and force of character were constantly
seeking new ways by which to make his church
services more attractive, and to increase his influence
over each member of his congregation.
&ldquo;He never asked himself what he <i>must</i> do, but
always what he <i>might</i> do.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iv.3" name="fna.iv.3" id="fna.iv.3">3</a></sup> But, work as industriously
as he would, his small society left him time
for other activities. While in London he had
been profoundly impressed by the noble labors of
Elizabeth Fry in the prisons of England. It was
this woman&#8217;s hand that pointed out the way for
Fliedner in Germany. The prisons in his own land
had remained untouched by any spirit of reform.
The convicts were crowded together in small, filthy
cells, and often in damp cellars without light or
air; boys, who had thoughtlessly committed some
trifling misdemeanor, with gray-headed, corrupt sinners;
young girls with the most vicious old women.
There was no attempt at classification of prisoners.
Some of them might be innocent people waiting
for trial. Neither was there oversight, save to
keep the prisoners from escaping. No work was
provided, and as for schools, where the larger number
of convicts could neither read nor write, no one<a
  id="png.060" name="png.060"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">060/</span>56</samp>
thought of such a thing.<sup><a href="#fn.iv.4" name="fna.iv.4" id="fna.iv.4">4</a></sup> That such idleness, the
beginning of all vice, was here especially pernicious
and corrupting can be readily seen. But few knew
of this state of things, and those few left it for the
government to provide a remedy.</p>

<p>Fliedner, however, could not rest in this indifference.
He says: &ldquo;The smallness of my charge
left me more leisure than most of my clerical
brethren, and the opportunities I had enjoyed on
my travels of at once collecting information and
strengthening my faith imposed a more urgent obligation
on me to try to make up by the help of
our God for our long neglect.&rdquo; He tried to obtain
permission to be imprisoned a few weeks in the
prison at Düsseldorf, that he might view prison life
from within the walls, but his request was refused.
He then obtained leave to hold services every other
Sunday afternoon in the prison at Düsseldorf. The
efforts that he put forth succeeded in waking the
interest of a great many persons, and at last there
was formed by his efforts the first society in behalf
of prisoners in Germany.</p>

<p>It was while engaged in this work that he met
his wife, Frederika Münster, who was occupied in
bettering the condition of the prisoners in the penitentiary
at Düsselthal. He married her in 1828,<a
  id="png.061" name="png.061"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">061/</span>57</samp>
and she became a helpful, inspiring co-worker with
him in all his undertakings.</p>

<p>In 1832 he was commissioned by the government
to revisit England, to furnish a report on the various
charitable organizations, especially those connected
with prisons and alms-houses. This brought
him into closer relations with Elizabeth Fry, as well
as with many other noble men and women of all
ranks who were caring for the poor and neglected
of England. He extended his journey to Scotland,
met Dr. Chalmers, and found his heart strangely
touched by what he saw. His spiritual experience
had deepened with the years, and while here he
wrote to some friends, &ldquo;The Lord greatly quickens
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His heart became still more open to works of
mercy and love, and he gathered rich experiences
which were afterward utilized in his work.</p>

<p>Fliedner had now attained a certain reputation
of his own as a friend to prisoners and outcasts.
It was not surprising, therefore, that a poor female
convict, discharged from the prison at Werden,
should have taken the weary six miles&#8217; walk to Kaiserswerth
September 17, 1833, to ask the good pastor
for help. There stood in the parsonage garden a
little summer-house twelve feet square, with an
attic. This was offered to the convict Minna as<a
  id="png.062" name="png.062"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">062/</span>58</samp>
a temporary refuge, and she became the first inmate
of the Kaiserswerth institutions. She had
arrived at an opportune moment. In the previous
spring Count Spee, the President of the Prison Society,
had urged the founding of two institutions,
one Lutheran and one Catholic, to receive discharged
female convicts. Fliedner, who had seen
such refuges in England, declared himself ready for
the plan, and tried to induce the pastors of the
larger and wealthier communities in the neighborhood
to locate the Protestant asylum in some one
of these cities. No one responded to his appeal.
His wife, whose courage was often greater than his
own, urged him to make a beginning in the little
village where he lived, unpromising as the conditions
seemed, and after a little hesitation, seeing no
one was ready to assume any responsibility in a
matter that he took so deeply to heart, the good
pastor decided to follow her advice. The old parsonage
was for rent, and he secured it on low
terms.</p>

<p>Frau Fliedner had a friend of her school-days
and early youth, now a woman of experience and
ability. She sent for her to come and visit them
to see if she would become the superintendent of
the refuge, but shortly after her arrival she was
taken sick, and her friends sent letters of expostulation<a
  id="png.063" name="png.063"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">063/</span>59</samp>
urging her to return. Just now, when affairs
were in rather an untoward state, appeared the first
inmate. Let Fliedner tell the story:</p>

<div class="longquote">
<p>&ldquo;We at first gave her lodging in my summer-house,
and the necessity of attending to her did
more good to the poor, distressed superintendent
than all her quinine and mixtures. Countess Spee,
the wife of our president, had prophesied that our
inmates would never remain with us a month, they
would certainly run away. So when the first month
was over I marched over to Heltorf and triumphantly
announced, &lsquo;Minna is yet there.&rsquo; Minna was
followed by another, and the garden-house became
too small.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Finally Fliedner obtained possession of the house
he had hired, after some delay on the part of the
former tenants, and the asylum was opened. The
number of inmates increased, and Fräulein Göbel
soon had more than she could manage. She must
have an assistant. The need of trained Christian
workers, who could care for these poor women,
grew daily more apparent.</p>

<p>Fliedner&#8217;s thoughts constantly dwelt on the subject;
they gave him no rest. He had discovered
with joyful surprise in 1827 the traces of the apostolic
deaconesses among the Mennonites, and two
years later he wrote:</p>
<a id="png.064" name="png.064"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">064/</span>60</samp>

<div class="longquote">
<p>&ldquo;Does not the experience of this our sister
Church, do not the women societies in our last
war, does not the holy activity of an Elizabeth Fry
and her helpers in England, and the women&#8217;s associations
of Russia and Prussia formed after their
model to care for the bodies and souls of women
prisoners&mdash;do all these not show what great power
God-fearing, pious women possess for the up-building
of Christ&#8217;s kingdom as soon as they have opportunity
to develop it?&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iv.5" name="fna.iv.5" id="fna.iv.5">5</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p>His practical experience with the work he had in
hand brought him to the same conclusion; namely,
that there must be training-schools where Christian
women, especially set apart for such service, could
have instruction and practice in the duties they had
undertaken. As a consequence there were drawn
up in May, 1836, and signed by Fliedner and a few
friends, the statutes of the Rhenish-Westphalian
Deaconess Society.</p>

<p>Fliedner had now reached the work that was
henceforth to be his life mission; that is, the restoration
of deaconesses to the Christian Church of the
nineteenth century.</p>

<h3 class="newchap">CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h4>THE INSTITUTIONS AT KAISERSWERTH.</h4>


<p><span class="smc">Fliedner</span> saw clearly that if the office of deaconess
were to be planted in the Church there must be
soil suitable to nourish it: in other words, there
must be an institution founded which could furnish
not only instruction, but practice in their duties,
and a home for those who should offer their services
for this office. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;could our little
Kaiserswerth be the right place for a Protestant
deaconess house for the training of Protestant
deaconesses&mdash;a village of scarcely eighteen hundred
people where the large majority of the
population were Roman Catholics, where sick
people could not be expected in sufficient numbers
for training purposes, and so poor that it
could not help defray even the yearly expenses
of such an institution? And were not older, more
experienced pastors than I better adapted for
this difficult undertaking? I went to my clerical
brethren in Düsseldorf, Dinsberg, Mettmann, Elberfeld,
and Barmen, and entreated them to start<a
  id="png.066" name="png.066"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">066/</span>62</samp>
such an institution in their large societies, of
which, indeed, there was pressing need. But all
refused, and urged me to put my hand to the work.
I had time, with my small congregation, and the
quietness of retired Kaiserswerth was favorable to
such a school. The useful experiences I had
gained on my journeys had not been given me for
naught, and God could send money, sick people,
and nurses. So we discerned that it was his will
that we should take the burden on our own shoulders,
and we willingly stretched them forth to receive
it. Quietly we looked around for a house for the
hospital. Suddenly, the largest and finest house in
Kaiserswerth was offered for sale. My wife begged
me to buy it without delay. It is true it would
cost twenty-three hundred thalers, and we had
no money. Yet I bought it with good courage,
April 20, 1836. At Martinmas the money must be
paid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not possible to give here in detail the occurrences
by which loans were made, and the money
that was needed obtained at the required time.
God gave friends for the cause, and through them
provided the means. The house was furnished
with a little second-hand furniture which had been
given him, and October, 1836, was opened as a hospital
and training school for Christian women. Services<a
  id="png.067" name="png.067"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">067/</span>63</samp>
of praise and thanksgiving consecrated this
deaconess home yet without deaconesses, this hospital
without patients. Both, however, soon became
inmates of the building. The first deaconess
was Gertrude Reichardt, the daughter of a physician.
She had assisted her father in the care of the
sick, and had become experienced in looking after
the welfare of the poor and the destitute. She
was an invaluable helper in the new enterprise, and
shared with the doctor the duty of giving instruction
in nursing and hospital duties. Fliedner&#8217;s
wife was the superintendent. She had the oversight
of the house, gave the deaconesses practical
direction in housekeeping, and in their early visits
to the sick and poor accompanied them from house
to house. Fliedner was the director, and took upon
himself the religious instruction of the sisters.
Every effort was taken to make the house a home
in which a cheerful, loving spirit should prevail.
Nearly every evening Fliedner or his wife would go
over to the home, and read to the sisters, or tell
them interesting facts outside their lives. When
he went away on his journeys he would write in
full every thing pertaining to the interests of the
common cause, and the letters would be read aloud.
This was to be a home in every sense of the word,
in which the members were to feel themselves<a
  id="png.068" name="png.068"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">068/</span>64</samp>
belonging to one great family, bound together by the
common tie of unselfish devotion to others &ldquo;for
Christ&#8217;s sake.&rdquo; The spirit of the founder has permeated
the institution even to the present time.
Those who know any thing of Kaiserswerth testify
to the strong affection for the common home, the
&ldquo;mother-house,&rdquo; as they beautifully term it, felt
by all its children. Every pains is taken to preserve
it. There is correspondence, frequent and
regular, from here to every sister. No matter in
what distant land she may be, her birthday is remembered,
and she is taught to look to this as a
waiting refuge for the days of trouble, sickness, and
old age.</p>

<p>There was soon arranged a series of house regulations
and instructions for work which became the
basis for after regulations in nearly all existing
institutions.</p>

<p>Almost contemporary with the mother-house
arose the normal school for infant-school teachers.
It had first started as a child&#8217;s school, and afterward
young women who had taste for the care of
children were received to be taught their duties.
Fliedner took great interest in the instruction of
children. He devised little games for them, and
arranged stories to be told. His simplicity and his
child-like nature led him to disregard formalities, and<a
  id="png.069" name="png.069"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">069/</span>65</samp>
to think solely of the end he had in view. On one
occasion, when picturing the combat of David and
Goliath, reaching that point in the narrative when
the young shepherd lad slings the stone that brings
the giant to the ground, he cast himself headlong,
to the great delight and amazement of his little
audience, who enjoyed to the full this object-lesson
that made the story so vivid to them.</p>

<p>Then he took special pains that his teachers
should learn to tell the stories of the Bible so as to
make them clear and interesting to the youngest
child. Every day a story was told in school, and each
evening the teacher whose turn it was to relate the
story the following day came to Fliedner and rehearsed
it to him as though he were a child, afterward
receiving his suggestions as to how the narrative
could be improved. The work went along
quietly, ever growing, ever advancing. &ldquo;Among
all others, and more than all others, was Fliedner&#8217;s
wife his best help. Her keen glance, made pure
and holy by her Christian faith, preserved him from
mistakes. With the household virtues of cleanliness,
order, simplicity, and economy she united
large-hearted compassion toward those needing
help of any kind, yet knowing withal how, with
virile sense and energy, to prevent the misuse of
ministering love. She became a model for the<a
  id="png.070" name="png.070"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">070/</span>66</samp>
deaconesses, as well as a mother to them, and her
name deserves to be mentioned with honor, as one
who had an important part in the Protestant renewal
of the diaconate of women.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.v.1" name="fna.v.1" id="fna.v.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1842 a new building was erected for the
normal school for infant-school teachers. The publishing
house of the institution was also started,
which issues religious books and tracts. The first
work sent forth was a volume of sermons, presented
to the new enterprise by the late Professor Lange,
which went through several editions.</p>

<p>The same year the <i>Kaiserswerth Almanac</i> appeared
and a large picture Bible for schools was
published. In 1848 the magazine <i>Der Armen und
Kranken Freund</i> was sent forth as an organ for the
deaconess cause, not only for Kaiserswerth, but for
all the institutions that are represented at the
triennial Conferences. The publishing house is an
important source of income, as the institution has
little in the way of endowment beside the produce
of the garden land attached to it. At present
about three fourths of the expense are met by the
sale of publications and the fees of patients; the
remaining sum is given by friends.</p>

<p>The financial story of Fliedner&#8217;s life could form
a tale of thrilling interest, if it were separated from<a
  id="png.071" name="png.071"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">071/</span>67</samp>
other facts and told by itself. He constantly
went forward, purchased houses, added lands, and
erected new homes when he had no money in
reserve, but unfailingly when the time came for
payments to be made the sum was obtained in
some way or other to meet them. &ldquo;We have no
endowment,&rdquo; he once said, &ldquo;but the Lord is our
endowment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same year, 1842, the orphan asylum was
opened. For a very moderate sum this receives
children who are both fatherless and motherless,
and who belong to the educated middle class, having
fathers who were pastors or professors, or the like.
Fliedner hoped not only to provide a home for
these girls befitting their station in life, but to develop
among them those who should make a vocation
of the care of children and the sick, and in
this hope he was not disappointed.</p>

<p>In the midst of these successes the hand of God
often lay heavily on Fliedner&#8217;s family. Brethren
and children passed away, and, sorest affliction of
all to him, his wife, who had so closely and sympathetically
shared all his labors, died April 22, 1842.
&ldquo;She was the first of the deaconesses to die,&rdquo; writes
Fliedner. &ldquo;As she, their mother, had always led
the way for her spiritual daughters in life, so she
was their leader into the valley of the shadow of<a
  id="png.072" name="png.072"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">072/</span>68</samp>
death.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.v.2" name="fna.v.2" id="fna.v.2">2</a></sup> Not long after this a normal school for
female teachers in the public schools was started,
for this practical believer in woman&#8217;s work was one
of the first to advocate the introduction of women
teachers in the public schools of Germany, against
which there then existed a strong prejudice. The
Board of Education looked favorably on his project,
and afterward sent a government commissioner
to attend the examinations and award the certificates
at Kaiserswerth. At a later period provision
was made for teachers of girls&#8217; high schools, as also
for those who desired to become teachers but were
too young to enter the normal school. Over two
thousand teachers have gone forth from these
schools, carrying with them a love for the institution
which has brought back to it many returns in
money and service. Fliedner well called them his
&ldquo;light skirmishing troops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1849 he resigned his pastorate, and henceforth,
with singleness of purpose, devoted himself to his
one calling. From time to time new buildings were
added to meet new needs. In 1852 an insane asylum
for Protestant women was founded, as sisters
were often called upon to nurse patients of this
class. The building set apart for the purpose was<a
  id="png.073" name="png.073"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">073/</span>69</samp>
formerly used as military barracks and was given
to Fliedner by King Frederick William IV. In
1881 this, as with so many others of the original
buildings at Kaiserswerth, became too small for the
increase in numbers, and a new building took its
place. It stands on an eminence just outside of the
village, and is provided with every modern appliance.
Fliedner&#8217;s practical good sense and administrative
ability led him to care for all the minor details
that were needed for the success of so great
an undertaking. He added a dispensary to the hospital,
where a sister who had passed a regular examination
before the government medical board
made up the medicines required for the hospital.
Many deaconesses have been trained to the same
knowledge, which has been an especially valuable
acquisition in the hospitals situated in Eastern
countries. Little by little he secured land for
farming operations, until there were one hundred
and eighty acres in garden and meadow land, generally
lying close about the various buildings, and
affording means of recreation as well to the inmates.
Nearly all of the vegetable and dairy products that
are needed are so provided. A bakery, bath-houses,
homes for laborers and officials, were added, and
bakers, shoemakers, carpenters, and blacksmiths
formed part of the staff of the great establishment.</p>
<a id="png.074" name="png.074"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">074/</span>70</samp>

<p>Gradually every variety of institution that could
furnish active practice to the deaconesses took its
place here, and the whole might be denominated a
great normal training-school for Christian women.
The refuge for discharged female convicts, which
was the starting-point of the movement, still
continued its good work during all these years.
The last report<sup><a href="#fn.v.3" name="fna.v.3" id="fna.v.3">3</a></sup> states that nine hundred and
nineteen women of different ages and different
degrees of wrong-doing have been its inmates.
Parents send insubordinate girls; societies forward
those who profess penitence; magistrates
sentence degraded creatures often too late for any
reasonable hope to reform them. The old experience
of the refuge is repeated in this last report:
one third are saved, one third are irredeemable, and
the judgment as to the remaining third, doubtful.
There were two buildings erected during the later
years of Fliedner&#8217;s life in which he took great interest.
One of these was a cottage among the
neighboring hills, where deaconesses who had become
exhausted by long days in the sick-room, or
whose health was suffering from over-toil, could
retire for a few weeks of mountain air and quiet
rest during the summer months. This pleasant retreat
was well named Salem. Soon afterward was<a
  id="png.075" name="png.075"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">075/</span>71</samp>
laid the corner-stone of the second building, regarded
with peculiar favor not only by the good
pastor, but by all friends of the institution. This
was the &ldquo;Feierabend Haus,&rdquo; the House of Evening
Rest, where, somewhat apart from the busy
activity of the great household, those deaconesses
whose best strength had been given to faithful labor
in the service could pass the evening hours of life
in quiet waiting for the last great change, while
using the experience they had gathered and the
strength still remaining in behalf of the cause they
had faithfully served.</p>

<p>Such are the main features of the great establishment
that year by year grew up in this village on
the Rhine. But from this as a center had gradually
branched off manifold lines of service, and many
daughter-houses both in Germany and foreign lands.
It was only a year and a half after the home was
opened that the first appointment of deaconesses
to work outside of Kaiserswerth was made.</p>

<p>This was an important victory for the new institution.
It took place January 21, 1838, on Fliedner&#8217;s
birthday, when he and his wife escorted two of the
sisters to Elberfeld, where they were to act as trained
nurses in the city hospital. From that time to
the present the hospital has continued under the
management of the Kaiserswerth deaconesses.</p>
<a id="png.076" name="png.076"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">076/</span>72</samp>

<p>Soon afterward sisters were sent out to nurse in
private families, and in 1839 two more were sent to
superintend the workhouse in Frankfort. As the
institution became known there was a constant demand
for superintendents, and matrons for public
reformatories, prisons, and charitable establishments.
Between 1846 and 1850 more than sixty deaconesses
were at work at twenty-five different stations outside
of the mother-house. About the same time
deaconesses began to work in connection with special
churches which called for their services, having
the duties which in England are assigned to those
called &ldquo;parish deaconesses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>King Frederick William IV., from the beginning
Fliedner&#8217;s faithful friend and supporter, had long
desired a deaconess home in Berlin. This was
finally obtained, and set apart under the name
&ldquo;Bethanien Haus,&rdquo; or Bethany House, October 10,
1847, at a special dedicatory service, at which the
king, with his court, was present. It was while
seeking a superintendent for this home in Berlin
that Fliedner learned to know Caroline Bertheau,
of Hamburg, a descendant of an old Huguenot
family that was driven from France by the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes. He led her home as
his wife in May, 1843, and she became to him a
true helpmeet for his children, his home, and his<a
  id="png.077" name="png.077"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">077/</span>73</samp>
institution. She is still living, having survived her
husband over twenty-five years, and in an advanced
age still retains a place on the Board of Direction
at Kaiserswerth.</p>

<p>In one place after another deaconess homes
arose, sometimes simply through Fliedner&#8217;s advice,
more often by his direct co-operation. From 1849
to 1851 he was chiefly engaged in traveling from
one land to another, occupied in kindling the zeal
of Christian women to devotion to the sick and sorrowing,
and finding fields of service for their priceless
ministrations. He visited the United States,
England, France, and Switzerland, as well as various
cities of the East, including Jerusalem and
Constantinople.</p>

<p>The work in our own land was begun at Pittsburg,
where Fliedner came with four sisters in the
summer of 1849, at the invitation of Pastor Passavant,
of the German Lutheran Church.</p>

<p>The deaconesses at once entered upon hospital
work, and their care of the sick met with warm appreciation,
but their numbers did not increase. An
orphanage was afterward started at Rochester, and
hospitals under the same auspices exist at Milwaukee,
Jacksonville, Ill., and Chicago. Still the
work has not grown, and it has proved the least
successful of any initiated by Fliedner. Upon his<a
  id="png.078" name="png.078"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">078/</span>74</samp>
return he aided in opening mother-houses in Breslau,
Königsberg, Dantzic, Stettin, and Carlsruhe.</p>

<p>We have now come to the period when Kaiserswerth
institutions met with a notable extension.
Fliedner had long been looking toward Jerusalem,
hoping to found a deaconess home there. &ldquo;Who
would not gladly render service on the spot where
the feet of the Saviour once brought help and healing
to the sick?&rdquo; he had said.</p>

<p>Now, through Dr. Gobat, the Bishop of Jerusalem,
the opportunity was given. The king offered
two small houses in Jerusalem that were his private
property, and volunteered to pay the expenses of
the journey. Associations were formed in all parts
of Germany to provide an outfit for the mission.
Gifts flowed in rapidly, and March 17, 1851, Fliedner,
accompanied by four deaconesses, two of them
being teachers, set out on this new and peaceful
crusade to the holy city. From that beginning
has resulted a net-work of stations throughout the
East.</p>

<p>There is at Jerusalem a hospital<sup><a href="#fn.v.4" name="fna.v.4" id="fna.v.4">4</a></sup> where, during
1887, four hundred and ninety-three patients were
given medical aid and nursing, and seven thousand
seven hundred and two patients were treated in the<a
  id="png.079" name="png.079"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">079/</span>75</samp>
dispensary. No woman in the city is better known
or more justly honored than Sister Charlotte, the
head-deaconess.</p>

<p>The Mohammedans at first regarded the work of
the sisters with fanatical distrust, but a glance at
the statistics of the last report will show how completely
they have cast aside their prejudices.</p>

<p>Of the 493 patients in 1887, there were 404 Arabians,
43 Armenians, 30 Germans, 5 Abyssinians, 4
Greeks, 3 Roumanians, 2 Russians, 1 Italian, and 1
Hollander. As to religion, there were 235 Mohammedans,
97 Protestants, 78 Greeks, 23 Roman Catholics,
45 Armenians, 6 Copts, 3 Syrian Christians, 4
Proselytes, 1 Jew, and 1 Maronite; so that in all
nine nations and nine religious faiths were represented
in the hospital.</p>

<p>There is also a girls&#8217; orphanage, called &ldquo;Talitha
Cumi,&rdquo; just outside the city walls at Jerusalem,
where one hundred and fourteen native girls were
last year taught by the Kaiserswerth deaconesses.
Over a hundred more made application to enter,
but there was no room to receive them. In Constantinople,
Alexandria, Cairo, Beirut, and Pesth
there are also well-appointed hospitals, some of
them of spacious dimensions, and all having excellent
medical service and nursing that cannot be
surpassed.</p>
<a id="png.080" name="png.080"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">080/</span>76</samp>

<p>The orphanage and school at Beirut had a sad
foundation. In 1860 came the terrible news of the
massacre of the Maronite Christians by the Druses
in the Lebanon mountains.</p>

<p>Kaiserswerth deaconesses were immediately sent
out, and were among the first to arrive to join the
resident Europeans and Americans in caring for the
sufferers. Numbers of children were left fatherless
and motherless, and the sisters started the orphanage
at Beirut to shelter them. When its twenty-fifth
anniversary was celebrated in 1885 over eight
hundred girls had received a home and education
here, and had gone forth to eastern homes, carrying
with them the light and knowledge of Christian
faith into the dark, degraded social life of the
Orient.<sup><a href="#fn.v.5" name="fna.v.5" id="fna.v.5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>From the two orphanages at Beirut and Jerusalem
over forty have gone out as teachers in girls&#8217;
schools in Palestine and Syria. Twelve others
have become deaconesses, and are ministering in
this capacity to their own countrymen and to foreigners
in eastern hospitals.<sup><a href="#fn.v.6" name="fna.v.6" id="fna.v.6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>In Smyrna there is also a girls&#8217; school, that was
opened at the request of some wealthy Protestants<a
  id="png.081" name="png.081"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">081/</span>77</samp>
residing there. The school is not so needed as
formerly, since the government has started girls&#8217;
high schools, but it is still maintained, and aids in
bringing new life into the hopeless society of the
East. There is also an orphanage at Smyrna,
where some girls of the poorer classes were gathered
after the ravages of the cholera had left them
without parents or homes.</p>

<p>The eastern deaconesses have also their Salem.
Just above the little village of Areya, in the Lebanon,
on the summit of a hill overlooking the Mediterranean,
stands the house of retreat, where, during
the summer months, the more than forty sisters
stationed in Beirut, Alexandria, Cairo, and Jerusalem
can take refuge in seasons of overpowering
heat.</p>

<p>The deaconess who superintends the house has a
school for the native children of the village, which
is taught by one of the girls educated at the Beirut
orphanage.</p>

<p>Prosperous girls&#8217; schools are also in existence at
Bucharest, and at Florence, Italy. The Italian
school was started in 1860 with four girls in the
upper floor of a rented house. It now possesses a
beautiful house and grounds of its own, and had
one hundred and forty-five girls under its charge
the past year. Most of these were Italians, but<a
  id="png.082" name="png.082"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">082/</span>78</samp>
different foreign residents also availed themselves
of the opportunity to send their children to an excellent
Protestant school. There is also a mission
at Rome maintained by deaconesses during the
winter months.</p>

<p>The large majority of the undertakings outside
of Kaiserswerth were initiated personally by Fliedner.
When we recall the complex demands of the
home field in Germany we marvel at the versatile
executive ability of this man, who started life as the
humble pastor of an obscure village church. But
he loved work. He possessed &ldquo;iron industry.&rdquo;
He was ever hopeful, courageous, and indefatigable.
Above all, he trusted completely in the leadings of
Divine Providence, and constantly went forward
with sure confidence. Then he was a true leader.
He knew men. He put the right person in the
right place, gave him full liberty of action, and held
him to a strict responsibility for results. So, while
Fliedner remained the soul of the great institution,
he knew how to make himself spared, which was
not the least of his qualifications for his calling.</p>

<h3 class="newchap">CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h4>THE REGULATIONS AT KAISERSWERTH, AND THE
DUTIES AND SERVICES OF THE DEACONESSES.</h4>


<p><span class="smc">The</span> regulations in daily use at Kaiserswerth are
based on those that Fliedner drew up in the early
days of the institution. They have been adopted
with few alterations by the larger number of deaconess
institutions that have since arisen, so that to
understand the spirit and usages prevailing in them
it is well to give these rules some study. They are
contained in a book numbering one hundred and
seven pages,<sup><a href="#fn.vi.1" name="fna.vi.1" id="fna.vi.1">1</a></sup> treating with great minuteness every
question that affects the daily lives of the deaconesses.
The qualities that the office demands are
first dwelt upon as they are described in Acts vi, 3,
and 1&nbsp;Tim. iii, 8, 9. The sisters are reminded that
their life is one of service; that they serve the Lord
Jesus; that they serve the poor and the sick and
helpless &ldquo;for Jesus&#8217; sake;&rdquo; and that they are servants
one of another.</p>
<a id="png.084" name="png.084"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">084/</span>80</samp>

<p>Special stress is given to the importance of cultivating
unity, love, and forbearance in the relations
of daily life, and the deaconesses are enjoined &ldquo;to
protect and further the honor of other sisters,&rdquo; &ldquo;to
form one family living unitedly as sisters, through
the tie of a heartfelt love for the one great object
that brings them to this place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are two classes of deaconesses formally
recognized, nurses and teachers; although there is
another, deaconess whose work is year by year becoming
more important, and that is the deaconess
who is attached to a church in the capacity of a
home missionary. She is designated by the term
&ldquo;commune-deaconess,&rdquo; or, as the English translate
it, &ldquo;parish-deaconess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those who desire to become nurse-deaconesses
must have the elements of a common school education,
must be in good health, and, as a general rule,
be over eighteen and not over forty years of age.
Most important of all is it that she possess personal
knowledge of the salvation of Christ, and a
living experience of the grace of God. Those who
desire to become teacher-deaconesses must, in addition,
present certain educational certificates, and be
able to sing. All must pass some months at the
mother-house, taking care of children and assisting
in housework, so that their fitness for the office can<a
  id="png.085" name="png.085"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">085/</span>81</samp>
be proven. A great deal of care is taken to test
the efficiency of the candidates, and only about one
half the probationers finally become deaconesses in
full connection. The teachers have, further, a seminary
course of one year for those who are to teach
in infant schools, of two years to prepare for the
elementary schools, and of three years for the girls&#8217;
high schools.</p>

<p>While probationers, they receive, free of charge,
board and instruction, and the caps, collars, and
aprons that are their distinctive badges. Their
remaining expenses they provide for themselves.
Those who have completed the full term of probation,
and have proved their fitness for the office,
must pledge themselves to a service of at least five
years. At the end of the time they may renew the
engagement or not, as they wish. Should a deaconess
be needed at home by aged parents, or
should she desire to marry, she is free to leave her
duties, but is expected to give three months&#8217; notice
of her intention to do so.</p>

<p>The deaconess performs her duties gratuitously.
This is a main feature of the system. She is not
even free to accept personal presents, for envy, jealousy,
and unworthy motives might then creep into
the system. She is truly &ldquo;the servant of the Lord
Jesus Christ.&rdquo; All of her wants are supplied, and<a
  id="png.086" name="png.086"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">086/</span>82</samp>
her future needs anticipated, so that, literally &ldquo;taking
no thought for the morrow,&rdquo; she can give herself
with single-hearted devotion to the work in
hand. The deaconess at Kaiserswerth receives from
the institution her modest wardrobe, consisting of a
Sunday suit, a working-dress of dark blue, blue
apron, white caps and collars. A deaconess attired in
her garb, with the placid, contented countenance that
seems distinctively to belong to her, is a pleasant,
wholesome sight that is constantly to be seen on
the streets of German cities. Her deaconess attire
is not only a protection, assuring her chivalrous
treatment from all classes of men, but it is a convenient
identification that insures her certain privileges
on the State railroads and steamboats, for the
German government recognizes the sisters as benefactors
of society, and treats them accordingly.
For her personal expenses the Kaiserswerth deaconess
in Germany receives yearly twenty-two dollars
and fifty cents; sometimes when in foreign lands
she is paid a slightly larger sum. When she becomes
unfitted for service by reason of sickness or
old age, and has no means of her own, the Board of
Direction provides for her maintenance.</p>

<p>The rules for probationers are full of practical
suggestions touching the details of daily life. There
is not space to transcribe them here, but those who<a
  id="png.087" name="png.087"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">087/</span>83</samp>
have charge of training schools will find them valuable
reading. Every kind of house and hospital
service is clearly defined. The deaconesses are instructed
what duties are theirs in hospitals for
women and in hospitals for men. In the latter
the sister undertakes only such nursing as is suited
to her sex, and for that reason she has a male
assistant. She must follow strictly the doctor&#8217;s
orders in all matters pertaining to diet, medicine,
and ventilation, and must inform him daily of the
patient&#8217;s state. She also assists the clergyman, if
desired, in ministering to spiritual needs. But she
must not obtrude her religion, when it is distasteful
to her patients; rather manifest it in her deeds and
manner of life.</p>

<p>Every portion of the day has definite duties
assigned to it. On reading them over you say,
Can much be accomplished when the hours are
subdivided into so many portions, and given over
to so many objects? But the unvarying testimony
is that no nurses accomplish more than
the German deaconesses. No matter how busy they
may be, the effort is made for each to have a quiet
half hour for meditation and private devotion.
Every afternoon the chapel is opened for this purpose,
and all the sisters who can be spared meet here.
A hymn is sung, and afterward each spends the<a
  id="png.088" name="png.088"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">088/</span>84</samp>
time as she will in meditation, reading the Bible or
silent prayer, the quietness and stillness being unbroken
by words. The &ldquo;Stille halbe Stunde,&rdquo; as
it is called, is greatly prized by the sisters, and is
observed by them in all their institutions, and
in all lands. There are Bible-classes and prayer-meetings
for the deaconesses during the week,
and the first Sunday of every month there is a
special service of prayer and thanksgiving for all
sisters, all the affiliated houses, and similar homes
wherever they exist. Fliedner prepared a book of
daily Bible readings for the use of the sisters, and
a hymn-book, used in all the Kaiserswerth institutions
at home and abroad. &ldquo;We have no vows,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and I will have no vows, but a bond of
union we must have, and the best bond is the word
of God, and our second bond is singing.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.2" name="fna.vi.2" id="fna.vi.2">2</a></sup> The
sisters of each house meet together to give their
votes for the admission of new deaconesses and the
election of the superintendents. Each deaconess
is expected to obey those who are placed over her,
and to accept the kind of work assigned her, except
in the case of contagious diseases, when her permission
is asked. What a tribute it is to these
women that such a refusal has never yet been
known! Every effort is made to harmonize the<a
  id="png.089" name="png.089"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">089/</span>85</samp>
right of the individual with the needs of the whole
body, a marked characteristic of the Protestant
sisters of charity.</p>

<p>When a probationer becomes a deaconess she
is consecrated to her work by a service the main
features of which it may be well to indicate. They
are as follows:</p>

<p>Singing. Address commending the deaconesses
for acceptance. Address to the deaconesses, recalling
the ever-repeated thought, &ldquo;You are servants in a
threefold sense: servants of the Lord Jesus; servants
of the needy for Jesus&#8217; sake; servants one of
another.&rdquo; Then, having answered the question,
&ldquo;Are you determined to fulfill these duties truly in
the fear of the Lord, and according to his holy
will?&rdquo; the candidate kneels and receives the benediction:
&ldquo;May the Triune God, God the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, bless you; may he give you
fidelity unto death, and then the crown of life.&rdquo;
After this is repeated the prayer of the <i>Apostolical
Constitutions</i>, that beautiful prayer which has been
said on similar occasions in many lands and in
many tongues.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.3" name="fna.vi.3" id="fna.vi.3">3</a></sup> The service ends with the communion.</p>

<p>A similar consecration service is used by nearly
all the German deaconess houses. The features of<a
  id="png.090" name="png.090"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">090/</span>86</samp>
those that meet together in the triennial Conferences
at Kaiserswerth are strikingly similar; the
spirit of the original founder pervades them all.</p>

<p>The first of the Conferences was held in 1861,
just twenty-five years after the founding of the first
deaconess house at Kaiserswerth. It was celebrated
as a Thanksgiving festival for the restoration of the
diaconate of women to the Church. The representatives
of twenty-seven distinct mother-houses met
together to exchange their experiences, and to deliberate
on matters touching the further usefulness
of the order.</p>

<p>Since then the Conferences have been continued
at intervals of three and four years. The last General
Conference assembled at Fliedner&#8217;s old home
in September, 1888.</p>

<p>Just before it convened, as is the custom, statistics
were obtained from the different mother-houses
represented in the association, and pains were taken
to verify their correctness. The results so obtained
are given in the following table:<sup><a href="#fn.vi.4" name="fna.vi.4" id="fna.vi.4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Five additional houses had made application for
entrance at the time the table was made, and were
received at the ensuing Conference, among which
was the Philadelphia mother-house of deaconesses
in connection with the Mary J. Drexel Home.</p>

<p>Over sixty mother-houses now belong to the association,
and notwithstanding the necessary loss of
deaconesses from death or removal from work since
the preceding Conference, there are 1,476 more in
number now than then. Surely the deaconess cause
is striking deep root in the religious life of Protestant
Europe. During Fliedner&#8217;s life-time occasions
arose which called the deaconesses outside their accustomed
fields of work, and proved their value in
the exceptional emergencies that so often arise.
Here is an instance that occurred during the early
days of the establishment:<sup><a href="#fn.vi.5" name="fna.vi.5" id="fna.vi.5">5</a></sup></p>

<div class="longquote">
<p>&ldquo;An epidemic of nervous fever was raging in two
communes of the circle of Duisburg, Gartrop, and<a
  id="png.092" name="png.092"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">092/</span>88</samp>
Gahlen. Its first and most virulent outbreak took
place at Gartrop, a small, poor, secluded village of
scarcely one hundred and thirty souls, without a
doctor, without an apothecary in the neighborhood,
while the clergyman was upon the point of
leaving for another parish, and his successor had
not yet been appointed. Four deaconesses, including
the superior, Pastor Fliedner&#8217;s wife, and a maid,
hastened to this scene of wretchedness, and found
from twenty to twenty-five fever patients in the
most alarming condition, a mother and four children
in one hovel, four other patients in another,
and so on, all lying on foul straw, or on bed-clothes
that had not been washed for weeks, almost without
food, utterly without help. Many had died already;
the healthy had fled; the parish doctor
lived four German leagues off, and could not come
every day. The first care of the sisters, who would
have found no lodging but for the then vacancy
of the parsonage, was to introduce cleanliness and
ventilation into the narrow cabins of the peasants;
they washed and cooked for the sick, they watched
every night by turns at their bed-side, and tended
them with such success that only four died after
their arrival, and the rest were only convalescent
after four weeks&#8217; stay. The same epidemic having
broken out in the neighboring commune of Gahlen,<a
  id="png.093" name="png.093"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">093/</span>89</samp>
in two families, of whom eight members lay ill at
once, a single deaconess was able, in three weeks,
to restore every patient to health, and to prevent
the further spread of the disease. What would not
our doctors give for a few dozen of such hard-working,
zealous, intelligent ministers in the field of
sanitary reform?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The Schleswig-Holstein war of 1864 was the
first in which Protestant deaconesses were active
as nurses. Already in the Crimean war the Greek
Sisters of Charity among the Russians, the Sisters
of Mercy among the French, and Florence Nightingale
and Miss Stanley among the English, had
wakened the liveliest gratitude on the part of the
soldiers, and secured the respect and approbation
of the surgeons.</p>

<p>In the Austrian war of 1866 two hundred and
eighty-two deaconesses were in the hospitals and
on the battle-fields, fifty-eight of whom were from
Kaiserswerth. The Franco-Prussian war of 1870 was
on a greater scale, and afforded wider opportunities
for the unselfish, priceless labors of these Christian
nurses. Neatly eight hundred deaconesses, sent
from more than thirty mother-houses, cared for the
sick and wounded in the camp hospitals or on the
field. The willingness of a number of boards of
administration to release sisters who were in their<a
  id="png.094" name="png.094"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">094/</span>90</samp>
service, and the voluntary offers of other women to
take their places, enabled Kaiserswerth to send two
hundred and twenty of the number. Their experience
in improvising hospitals, in aiding the surgeon
in his amputations, and in ministering to the
wounded and dying, throws a tender glow of compassionate
sympathy over the terrible scenes of
war.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.6" name="fna.vi.6" id="fna.vi.6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>The importance of trained deaconesses in times
of war is now well understood by the military authorities
at Berlin. In the winter of 1887, when
war seemed imminent, the directors of the German
deaconess houses were summoned by the government
to a conference at the German capital to take
measures for supplying nurses in case war should
be declared.</p>

<p>Deaconesses are now thoroughly incorporated
into the religious and social features of the German
national life, as must be admitted by any
one who has weighed the facts that have been
given.</p>

<p>The example of Kaiserswerth has been far-reaching;
the mission of Fliedner, that simple-hearted,
true-souled, practical, energetic pastor, has been
wonderfully successful.</p>

<p>In this rapid sketch I have said but little of the<a
  id="png.095" name="png.095"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">095/</span>91</samp>
hinderances he met, nothing of the ridicule which
at first attacked him unsparingly. He paid no
heed to these obstacles, and why should we waste
time in detailing them? Steadfastly and undeviatingly
he went forward toward the end he had in
view; that is, to restore in all its aspects the
devoted disciplined services of Christian women
to the Church. He passed away from life October
5, 1864, leaving the great establishment that
he had watched over in the charge of his son-in-law,
Pastor Disselhoff, and other members of his
family.</p>

<p>The institution has become an imposing mass of
building, forming an almost absurd contrast to the
little garden house, the cradle of the whole establishment,
which is still standing in the parsonage
garden.</p>

<p>When the fiftieth anniversary of the rise of the
deaconess cause was celebrated in 1886 the Kaiserswerth
sisterhood put their mites together and purchased
the little house, to hold it in perpetuity as a
monument of God&#8217;s providence.</p>

<p>The symbol of Kaiserswerth is a white dove, carrying
an olive branch, resting against a blue ground.
The blue flag floats from the old windmill tower
on the river-bank, attracting the attention of the
traveler as he floats up the Rhine.</p>
<a id="png.096" name="png.096"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">096/</span>92</samp>

<p>Other flags bear messages of conquest, of victory,
of battles fought and won, of storm and stress and
endeavor in the conflict of man against his fellow-man.
But only peace and good-will, the victory of
goodness and of love&mdash;these alone are the messages
that are waved forth to the wind by the blue flag
of Kaiserswerth.</p>

<h3 class="newchap">CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<h4>OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS ON THE CONTINENT.</h4>


<p><span class="smc">In</span> a book of these dimensions no exhaustive
historical account can be given of all the developments
of the deaconess movement in the various
countries on the Continent. Only a few of the
leading houses can be spoken of, but through a
knowledge of these we can gain an insight into
the life and characteristics of the movement as a
whole.</p>

<p>The mother-house at Strasburg is one of the
oldest ones, dating from 1842. It owes its origin
to the holy enthusiasm and life experiences of
Pastor Härter, who exercised a deep religious influence
in the city where he lived. In 1817, when
he was a young man of twenty, the great Strasburg
hospital was re-organized. The six to eight hundred
patients were divided according to their religious
faith. To the Catholics were assigned as nurses
Sisters of Charity. For the Protestants there were
paid women nurses.</p>

<p>The magistrates appealed to the pastors to find<a
  id="png.098" name="png.098"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">098/</span>94</samp>
at least two Protestant women of experience and
ability to oversee the nurses, but the most persistent
search in the various churches of Strasburg
failed to procure suitable candidates. Years afterward,
when death entered Härter&#8217;s family circle,
and his life became clouded and darkened, he was
called as a pastor to the largest church in Strasburg.
He entered upon his new pastorate with a
heart heavy and sad, and not until after ten months
of struggle, in which the depths of his soul were
stirred, did he come forth strong, confident, and
positive as never before that &ldquo;Jesus Christ came
into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.&rdquo;
Henceforth there was force to his life, conviction
in his words, and never-ceasing energy in good
works.</p>

<p>When he heard of Fliedner&#8217;s new undertaking
below him on the Rhine he remembered the difficulty
in finding Protestant nurses for the hospital, and
declared that Strasburg must have a similar institution.
He won the support of a number of Christian
men and women, and the house was opened in
October, 1842. From its beginning many branches
of charitable and religious work were undertaken.
Especial attention was at first given to preparing
Christian teachers, and the schools in connection with
the deaconess house were filled with pupils. The<a
  id="png.099" name="png.099"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">099/</span>95</samp>
success in this particular aroused apprehension lest
the deaconesses should be diverted from their legitimate
duties in caring for outside interests, so for a
time the schools were discontinued. They have
been resumed, however, and are to-day prosperous
as of old.<sup><a href="#fn.vii.1" name="fna.vii.1" id="fna.vii.1">1</a></sup> There are also a hospital, a home for
aged women, a servants&#8217; training-school and a
foundling asylum under the charge of the deaconesses.
They are, as a class, of higher social rank
than these of Kaiserswerth, the preponderating
number of whom are from the lower grade of social
life. They are also better educated. This is
partly a necessity, from the fact that the city is on
the border-land between two great nations and if
the deaconesses are to be effective they must be
familiar with the spoken and written speech of both
peoples. Strasburg continues to be a great and
powerful center of deaconess activities, having a
number of branch houses and various fields of
work.</p>

<p>The affiliated house at Mülhausen has obtained
an especially good report for its successful use of
parish deaconesses. No other house has so systematized
their labors or developed their possibilities
as has the deaconess house at Mülhausen. All
the authorities on deaconess work agree that the<a
  id="png.100" name="png.100"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">100/</span>96</samp>
office of the parish deaconess is the crown and
glory of the diaconate, and approaches most nearly
the type of the deaconesses of the early Church.</p>

<p>The parish deaconess has occasion to use every
gift which she can possibly acquire in the varied
training of the deaconess school. She must know
how to care for the poor, the weak, the sick, and those
needing help for either body or soul, as she finds
them in her visits from house to house. She must
be able to pray at the bedside of the rich man,
and to serve in the kitchen of the poor man;
to be motherly to children, sympathetic with
the sorrowing, and silent with the complaining.
She must be an intelligent nurse, having some
knowledge of medicine, able to faithfully carry out
the instructions of the physician. She must be
keen in detecting imposition, and wise in the administration
of charity, knowing that &ldquo;to deny is
often to help, and to give is often to corrupt.&rdquo;
Truly, there is no gift of Christian womanhood
which has not here its use.</p>

<p>For many reasons Mülhausen was well adapted
for a field of labor for parish deaconesses. It is
an old city, dating back to medi&aelig;val times, having a
population of about sixty thousand inhabitants, half
of whom are workmen. It has long been known
for its noble and successful endeavors to promote<a
  id="png.101" name="png.101"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">101/</span>97</samp>
the well-being of the working class. One of the
first building and loan associations was started here
to enable the operatives to earn their homes by
gradual payments. Other organizations whose object
is the moral elevation of the employees have
united the different social circles by strong ties of
sympathy. It was an easy matter, therefore, to
raise a subscription of two hundred thousand francs
to provide a home for the deaconesses who were
invited here from Strasburg in 1861. There are
now fourteen sisters in the deaconess house. Half
of the number remain at the home to nurse the
sick, and perform house duties. The remainder
are parish deaconesses, who go forth early in the
morning, each to her own quarter of the city, where
she is busy at her labors during the day. In the
evening she returns to the central home. In each of
the seven districts into which the city is divided is
located a district house; a pleasant, well-kept place.
This contains a waiting-room for the deaconess
and a consultation-room for the district physician,
who comes at stated hours during the week. The
poor who are recommended by the sister he treats
gratuitously, and, so far as the physician directs, she
furnishes food gratuitously. She keeps on hand a
good stock of lint, bandages, and instruments.
Each house has a kitchen and cellar. Every morning<a
  id="png.102" name="png.102"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">102/</span>98</samp>
a woman comes in and prepares a large kettle
of nourishing soup, and at 11 A.&nbsp;M. this is given
out to the sick and poor.</p>

<p>In the store-room are rice, sugar, coffee, meal,
and similar articles of food. From here she sends
out at noon such portions as are needed for the
most destitute of the district. In winter she also
sells from her stores to the poor. Then there is a
closet amply provided with sewing materials, and
when the deaconess obtains work for seamstresses
she furnishes them at a small price the necessary
outfit to begin sewing. At two o&#8217;clock the deaconess
ends her duties at the district house, and spends
the remainder of the day in making visits in her
quarter. To provide means to support the constant
expenditure, there is in each quarter of the
city a committee of fifteen ladies and three gentlemen,
being in all more than one hundred ladies and
twenty gentlemen, who are responsible for the administration
of the charity. Each committee has a
yearly collection in its district, and in this way about
forty thousand francs are gathered annually. In
each quarter nine hundred francs (one hundred and
eighty dollars) is set apart for the maintenance of
the sister and the rent of the district house. The
remaining sum is expended by the deaconesses in
their several districts in caring for the sick and<a
  id="png.103" name="png.103"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">103/</span>99</samp>
destitute. Every month each one receives the sum
allotted her from the treasurer, and in return reports
her expenditure. The ladies on the committee
often give personal assistance to the deaconess,
and sometimes assume responsibility for
individual cases, or for an entire street. The arrangements
are constantly being improved upon
as knowledge is gained by practice. The experience
that has been gathered at Mülhausen is very
practical, and therefore very valuable. Similar
work could be undertaken in any of our large
American cities, with the anticipation of like
beneficent results. For that reason the above detailed
description has been ventured upon, with the
hope that the Old World example will find imitators
in the New.<sup><a href="#fn.vii.2" name="fna.vii.2" id="fna.vii.2">2</a></sup> Similar institutions, although
not so carefully perfected, are found in Gorlitz and
Magdeburg.</p>

<p>In Berlin are a good many deaconess institutions.
Among them is the Marthashof, a training-school
for servants, and a home for those out of employment.</p>

<p>The first impulse to care for the girls who come
to large cities to obtain work, and to provide them
a home where they can have respectable surroundings,<a
  id="png.104" name="png.104"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">104/</span>100</samp>
came from Pastor Vermeil, the founder of the
deaconess house at Paris. When Fliedner visited
the Paris house his heart was touched by what he
saw. He thought of the thousands of girls coming
annually to Berlin from the provinces, and of the
exposures and temptations to which they were subjected.
He knew that many of them in their ignorance
and inexperience were ruined body and soul
in the lodging-houses to which they resorted, and
drifted away on the streets of the city, only to find
a place eventually in the hopeless wards of the great
hospital, La Charité.</p>

<p>He determined to do what he could to provide a
remedy, and, as was his wont, &ldquo;without money and
without noise&rdquo; he set to work. In the north of
Berlin, at quite a distance from the railroad stations,
he hired a small house on a street then called &ldquo;The
Lost Way&rdquo;&mdash;a street well named, as it was unlighted
and unpaved, and so poorly kept that when
the queen came to visit the home, shortly after it
was opened, her carriage, in spite of the strong
horses, got stuck in the mud.</p>

<p>By the aid of some ladies in the city the home
was furnished with twelve beds; three deaconesses
were put in charge, and after perplexing difficulties
the authorization to open a registry for servants
was obtained. The idea at first met with<a
  id="png.105" name="png.105"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">105/</span>101</samp>
derision. It was said that such an institution was
rightly located on &ldquo;The Lost Way,&rdquo; for no one
would ever come to it. But they came. In two
years the number of beds increased to twenty, and
the same year Fliedner purchased the entire court
in which the house stood, containing five houses
and a fine garden. Queen Elizabeth of Prussia became
the patroness of the institution, and it grew
in favor with the people. A training-school was
added in which the girls were taught to wash, iron,
cook, and sew, and also to work in the garden and
to care for cows, the last two branches of domestic
service being required of servant-girls in Germany.
Later an infant school was added in which nursery
girls were practiced in taking charge of children, a
pleasant, helpful demeanor being made one of the
requisites. Over two hundred children, mostly
coming from the poorest and gloomiest homes, are
in daily attendance. About three hundred and
fifty more attend the girls&#8217; school for children of
the working classes. In the home and training-school
for servants about eight hundred girls are
received annually, and sixteen thousand have been
sheltered and taught during the years it has been
open. They readily secure situations, over two
thousand applications being annually received for
the servants of the Marthashof. They remain in<a
  id="png.106" name="png.106"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">106/</span>102</samp>
friendly relation to the home, receive good counsel
and advice, and are encouraged to spend their free
Sundays there.</p>

<p>The Marthashof has had a beneficent influence
over the moral and spiritual welfare of servants
throughout Germany. In nearly all the cities similar
homes are now established, while in the larger
cities Sunday associations are formed to provide
suitable places of meeting for the entertainment
and instruction of those who are free Sunday afternoons
and evenings. So far as I am aware, no similar
work has been attempted for servant-girls in
the United States. It is true that training-schools
exist, but not with religious supervision, and with
the moral and religious instruction of the inmates
made a prominent feature. The Marthashof offers
us a lesson well worth our learning.</p>

<p>The deaconess house, &ldquo;Bethanien,&rdquo; in Berlin, was
founded by King Frederick William IV., who as the
Crown Prince took a warm interest in Fliedner&#8217;s
undertakings.<sup><a href="#fn.vii.3" name="fna.vii.3" id="fna.vii.3">3</a></sup>
It still remains under the protection<a
  id="png.107" name="png.107"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">107/</span>103</samp>
of the emperor, and is one of the most important
mother-houses. Over three thousand patients are
annually admitted to the hospital connected with
the house, and five hundred children are treated at
a dispensary devoted solely to cases of diphtheria.
Outside of the city it has thirty-three stations.
There are also the Lazarus Hospital and Deaconess
Home, the Paul Gerhardt Deaconess Home, provided
for parish deaconesses, and the Elizabeth
Hospital and Home, which started independently
but is now allied to Kaiserswerth.</p>

<p>The deaconess house in Neudettelsau stands in
closest union with the Lutheran Church. The sisters
are mostly from the higher ranks of society,
and intellectual training is made prominent. Certain
liturgical forms are used, and in the main
deaconesses are employed in preparing ecclesiastical
vestments and embroideries for church
adornment.</p>

<p>In marked contrast to Dettelsau is the deaconess
house at Berne. It is almost a private
institution, having only slight connection with
the State Church. It owes its origin to Sophie
Wurdemberger, a member of one of the old patrician
families of Berne. A visit to England made
her acquainted with Elizabeth Fry, with the usual
beneficent result of increased interest and activity<a
  id="png.108" name="png.108"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">108/</span>104</samp>
in good works. On her return to Berne she gained
the support of a society of women, and through
their aid secured a hospital and deaconess home.
It is now fourth in number among the largest
mother-houses, has two hundred and ninety-seven
deaconesses, five affiliated houses, and forty-five
different fields of work.</p>

<p>The oldest mother-house in Switzerland is at St.
Loup, not far from Lausanne, standing on one of
the beautiful heights of that picturesque region.
It was founded by Pastor Germond in 1841, through
the direct influence of the work at Kaiserswerth.
There are now seventy-three deaconesses, mostly
acting as nurses either in private homes or public
institutions.<sup><a href="#fn.vii.4" name="fna.vii.4" id="fna.vii.4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>There is also a large institution at Riehen near
Basel, which sends out two hundred deaconesses.
The greater number are of the peasant class, and are
nearly all employed as nurses. The home at <ins class="transcriber"
  title="Transcriber's note: original has 'Zurich'">Zürich</ins>
was at first a daughter-house of Riehen, but is now
an independent institution with twenty-seven stations.
In Austria there is a mother-house at Gallneukirchen
from which sisters are sent forth, four
of them working in as many Vienna parishes. The
story of deaconess work in Austria is an interesting
one, and is told by Miss Williams in a recent<a
  id="png.109" name="png.109"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">109/</span>105</samp>
number of <i>The Churchman</i>, from which the following
extracts are taken:</p>

<div class="longquote">
<p>&ldquo;The Protestants of Gallneukirchen were first
formed into an independent parish in the year
1872, and it is the only one lying between the
Danube and the Bohemian frontier. It is very
widely extended, but numbers only three hundred
and eighteen souls, and is so poor that with the
greatest effort it can raise only four hundred florins
a year (about one hundred and sixty dollars) for
church and school. With the aid of those interested
in the work a parish-house has been secured,
where the pastor and his wife reside, and in which
is the deaconess asylum for the aged, infirm, and
insane of all classes. It has not as yet been possible
to clear off the debt on the purchase. Still the
sisters strive in every way to enlarge their usefulness,
so that they now possess extensive buildings
and farms&mdash;only partly paid for, it is true&mdash;wherein
to house the many afflicted who apply to them for
aid. In one building, standing alone on a hill, they
purpose to collect the insane patients, and suitable
additions are now being made to insure their safety
and comfort. In another village, two hours&#8217; drive
from here, is their school, where more than sixty
boys and girls are taught, fed, and clothed, in most
cases gratuitously, at worst at a nominal charge.&rdquo;</p>
<a id="png.110" name="png.110"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">110/</span>106</samp>

<p>&ldquo;The sisters are bright and cheerful, and keep
their various dwellings so exquisitely neat and clean,
with their white-washed walls adorned with Scripture
texts and pictures. No work, however menial,
is beneath them. I have myself seen one scrubbing
the stairs, and in turns they sleep on a hard
straw bed on the floor, ready to rise in the night
as often as a bell summons them to the aid of a
suffering invalid or a refractory lunatic.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>There are a few institutions that exist independently
of those represented at the Kaiserswerth
General Conference. They stand alone for various
reasons; perhaps they have not met the conditions
required of those which belong to the association.
Any house whose administration rests exclusively
either in the hands of a man or a woman is excluded
from the Conference. In every mother-house there
represented the administrative head is twofold,
consisting of a gentleman, who, with rare exceptions,
is a clergyman, and a lady who is a deaconess.
The Kaiserswerth authorities regard this joint
management as an indispensable condition.</p>

<p>The rector, as he is usually called, cares for the
intellectual and spiritual instruction of the probationers,
conducts public services in the chapel, and
issues the publications and reports of the house.</p>

<p>The oberin, or house-mother, is the direct head<a
  id="png.111" name="png.111"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">111/</span>107</samp>
of the sisters. She is responsible for the interior
management, regulates the duties of the sisters, and
gives practical instruction. The two are jointly
responsible for the acceptance and dismissal of probationers,
for the assignment of the sisters to different
fields of labor, and the kind of labor required.
Every mother-house has its own peculiarities. The
personal characteristics of those who conduct it are
naturally impressed upon the house.</p>

<p>Then, too, the influence of environment is to be
reckoned with. The house may be located in a
large city or in a small one; in the country or in
towns. It may be under the influence of a State
Church, as in Germany, or of Christians of all
Churches, as at Mildmay. It will share the characteristics
of the race of people from which come its
workers. Doubtless in the Methodist Episcopal
Church in America the deaconesses that eventually
become recognized as set apart to special Christian
service, through the training that is provided for
them, will be women who are peculiarly adapted to
the needs of that Church, with all the distinguishing
American traits that will prepare them to understand
the people whom they are to serve, and that
will give them access to the hearts of this people.</p>

<p>If the deaconess cause should gain favor with us
as it has in Europe, and should the deaconesses<a
  id="png.112" name="png.112"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">112/</span>108</samp>
become as established in the social life of the
people as they are there, the effective agencies will
be largely increased that are to deal with the questions
that come to the front whenever, as in great
cities, large numbers of people are massed together.</p>

<p>Deaconess institutions now exist in Switzerland,
France, Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Russia,
Austria, England, and Germany, while the countries
in which these homes have stations are literally
too numerous to mention. Spain, Italy,
Greece, Turkey, the countries of Northern Africa,
and of Asia Minor, as well as isolated mission stations
throughout the entire world are now served
by deaconesses.</p>

<p>If there were ten times the number of sisters,
places could be at once found for them. It is instructive
on this point to read what Pastor Disselhoff
says<sup><a href="#fn.vii.5" name="fna.vii.5" id="fna.vii.5">5</a></sup> in the account he gives of the various
demands made upon him, which he has been unable
to meet. One of the letters he quotes was from an
English missionary on the Cameron River. &ldquo;Send
us deaconesses for our hospital,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It was
built for European sailors, especially Germans.
We hope and trust to overcome the superstitions
of the natives, and that they too, may come to be
healed.&rdquo; But there were no sisters to send.</p>
<a id="png.113" name="png.113"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">113/</span>109</samp>

<p>A similar call came from Shanghai, but as it was
impossible to return a favorable answer, although
the hospital was a Protestant institution, the Sisters
of Mercy were invited in, and given control.
From 1870 up to 1886 over two hundred and twenty-seven
places at widely remote distances, such as
Madras, New Orleans, Port Said, Rio de Janeiro,
and elsewhere, sent most urgent appeals for Kaiserswerth
deaconesses to be assigned them, but
invariably the same answer must be returned:
&ldquo;There are none to send.&rdquo; Disselhoff closes by
saying, &ldquo;How many open doors has God given!
Whose fault is it that they remain closed?&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="newchap">CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<h4>DEACONESSES IN GERMAN METHODISM.</h4>


<p><span class="smc">The</span> good results of the work of deaconesses in
the other Protestant bodies of Germany doubtless
had their influence upon German Methodism. As
far back as 1868 in Wurtemberg, and later in
Frankfort, some preachers introduced parish deaconesses
for the care of the sick; but well-directed
efforts, and unity in management, were lacking.</p>

<p>The existing association was started July 8, 1874,
under the title of &ldquo;Bethanienverein,&rdquo; or the Bethany
Society, through the efforts of several members
of the German Conference, among whom were Rev.
G. Weiss, who, with two deaconesses, initiated the
work in Bremen, Rev. Frederick Eilers, the present
inspector, and Rev. G. Hausser, who for several
years was president of the board of direction, and
now resides in America.<sup><a href="#fn.viii.1" name="fna.viii.1" id="fna.viii.1">1</a></sup> A further number of
ministers showed themselves inclined to stand by
the society, both by their influence and through
contributions taken in their churches, so that in<a
  id="png.115" name="png.115"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">115/</span>111</samp>
1876 the first trained deaconesses were set at work
in the city of Frankfort.</p>

<p>As has been said,<sup><a href="#fn.viii.2" name="fna.viii.2" id="fna.viii.2">2</a></sup> the little institution in its
early days had to pass through a series of critical
experiences, as a young child has to encounter the
series of childhood diseases that assail it; but it
outlived them all, and is now enjoying a vigorous
youth. It was but another illustration of the truth
that all beginnings are difficult, and that successful
experience has to be bought by overcoming hinderances
and obstacles.</p>

<p>To-day there is no branch of German Methodism
more successfully and substantially incorporated
into the Church life than the deaconess society,
and none that wins greater favor among those outside
of denominational lines.</p>

<p>The first printed report was issued in October,
1884. In this the inspector says: &ldquo;Our society is
now in three cities, Frankfort, Hamburg, and Berlin,
and our sisters are not able to meet all the demands
upon them for service.&rdquo; At that time there
were thirteen deaconesses and twenty probationers.
The last report, issued in July, 1888, shows an
increase in numbers both of deaconesses and their
stations. There are now eighty-nine deaconesses,<a
  id="png.116" name="png.116"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">116/</span>112</samp>
eleven of whom are probationers, and there are
stations in five places. Besides the ones previously
mentioned in Germany, two additional stations
have been started in Switzerland: one in Zürich,
and one in St. Gall.</p>

<p>Nearly all the Methodist German deaconesses
are engaged in caring for the sick; it is only
recently that attempts have been made in some
other directions of charitable endeavor. In the last
report we are told that at Frankfort steps have
been taken to reform fallen women. One of the
sisters seems to be especially endowed with tact
and ability for this difficult work. She has already
induced twenty-two of these girls to enter the
asylum at Sachsenhausen. The police authorities
and city magistrates have given this same sister
access to the women prisoners, which is a decided
favor, coming from German officials. Besides her
work in this particular, she has devoted her remaining
time to the care of the poor and the sick.</p>

<p>Many deaconesses were called upon to go out as
nurses in private families, and, in order to obtain
room to accommodate the added number these services
required, it has been necessary to rent an additional
house. There are two clinics in connection
with the institution; one for those suffering from
nose, throat, or lung diseases, the other for diseases<a
  id="png.117" name="png.117"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">117/</span>113</samp>
of women. In both, the hours of consultation
are free, and attract numerous visitors. Two
hundred and forty-six people were received in the
hospital last year, and were cared for in four thousand
one hundred and fifty days of nursing. Spiritual
results are also anticipated from the seed of
God&#8217;s word sown in the hearts of the sick through
daily prayer and Sunday services.</p>

<p>The house at Frankfort is too small for its increasing
needs, and a permanent home of more
ample dimensions is greatly to be desired.</p>

<p>In Hamburg the house has been enlarged, and
there is now room for thirty-five sisters; yet still
there are more demands made than can be met.
In one month ninety requests were handed in for
the aid of the deaconesses. The city authorities
offered them a large lot of land at a very moderate
sum, which is at present used as a garden,
and adds much to the enjoyment of the home.</p>

<p>On the 4th of March, 1888, occurred the anniversary
of the founding of the Hamburg house, at
which time six sisters were set apart to their life
calling by a service of consecration. As in all
places where our deaconesses are employed, so also
in Hamburg their influence is felt in the increase of
religious life among the families they serve.</p>

<p>In Berlin, again, there is an imperative call for<a
  id="png.118" name="png.118"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">118/</span>114</samp>
enlarged house accommodations, and more sisters
are needed to meet the requests for help that are
constantly coming to them. As the report expresses
it, &ldquo;Something must happen!&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.viii.3" name="fna.viii.3" id="fna.viii.3">3</a></sup> After six years
of activity in Berlin the deaconesses find themselves
well appreciated, and with a broad field of
labor. The city authorities gave them permission
to take a house collection during the months of
February and March. One of the German ministers
said, &ldquo;This is an unusual favor, only granted in
exceptional cases, as when a village is swept away,
or there is an inundation, or a failure of harvests.&rdquo;
This collection was no easy task. In the depth of
winter, in rigorous cold and snow the sisters had
to climb weary flights of stairs, in houses four and
five stories high, arranged in flats; to knock at
many doors, often meeting with but slight success
or a positive refusal; yet daily they went with
fresh courage to their work, encouraged by the
thought that they were toiling not for themselves,
but to serve the needy, &ldquo;for Jesus&#8217; sake.&rdquo; The
collection resulted in obtaining nearly twenty
thousand marks, to which has been added the loan
of a larger sum at a small rate of interest, so that
there is good prospect of soon obtaining a permanent
home as the property of the deaconess society.</p>
<a id="png.119" name="png.119"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">119/</span>115</samp>

<p>St. Gall is one of the newer stations, but from
the beginning it has been a work of promise. In
this old center of missionary operations, where
Irish missionaries founded one of the most famous
monasteries of medi&aelig;val times, is now to be erected
a hospital under the care of Methodist deaconesses,
who have already begun to collect means for this
purpose. In Scheffel&#8217;s famous story of <i>Ekkehard</i>
the only way in which the Duchess Hadwig could
enter the monastery of St. Gall (as there was a law
that no woman should set her foot upon the threshold)
was by the ingenious device of a young monk,
who lifted her over in his arms. These peaceful
women of Methodism are finding no obstacle now
as did Hadwig of old; they do not need even figuratively
to be lifted over the entering threshold;
they are gladly welcomed, and are introducing a
new element into the life of the old city.</p>

<p>In Zürich seven deaconesses are at work under
the protection, and with the sympathetic co-operation,
of the pastor and the church. I saw something
of the deaconesses and their duties in this place.
The inspector, Rev. Fr. Eilers, came with the first
deaconesses and introduced them to their new field
when I was a resident of the city. On Sunday
morning he occupied the pulpit, preaching from
Rom. xvi, 1, commending the deaconesses to the<a
  id="png.120" name="png.120"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">120/</span>116</samp>
kindness and helpful aid of the members of the
church. I used often to see Sister Myrtha, who was
the head sister, hastening hither and thither on her
errands of mercy. In her plain black dress and
round shoulder-cape to match, and broad white collar
and white cap, she was a pleasant and attractive
figure. She was always happy and contented, ready
to answer the many questions with which I plied
her in my desire to look through the eyes of a deaconess,
and to obtain her views of the office to which
she belonged. She had a great love for her work,
and believed that she was doing service for Christ
in a true missionary field. Her simple uniform was
a distinguishing mark that insured her respect and
attention wherever she went, and she regarded it as
a garb of honor that marked her as belonging to
the daughters of the great King. You could not
call such a life an austere or unnatural one. It was
too thoroughly filled with thoughts of love to others
to be either morbid or introspective. I obtained
my first favorable impressions of the usefulness of
deaconesses and their importance to the Church
from the cheerful, contented labors of Sister Myrtha
and her associates among the poor and sick of Zürich&mdash;quiet
women, of no particular prominence in
the social world, and not learned or accomplished;
&ldquo;<i>nur einfache Mädchen</i>&rdquo; (only simple maidens,<a
  id="png.121" name="png.121"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">121/</span>117</samp>
quiet, ordinary women, as we might translate Sister
Myrtha&#8217;s own phrase), but living &ldquo;not to be ministered
unto, but to minister,&rdquo; commending their
creed by their deeds, and winning sympathy by the
loving, self-denying spirit that they manifest.</p>

<p>During the last year a house of rest has been
opened similar to the house Salem at Kaiserswerth.
This is called by the beautiful name &ldquo;<i>Gottestreue</i>,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;God&#8217;s Fidelity.&rdquo; The report says that they
have named it God&#8217;s Fidelity in recollection of this:
&ldquo;That the Lord has so faithfully led us and has
cared for us in all storms which, especially at the
beginning of the work, threatened to overwhelm it,
has watched over us and upheld us, and has so
richly blessed us.&rdquo; The acquisition of this house
came through the work of the sisters. One of
them was caring for an aged widow, whose sympathies
were so won that she offered to give her property,
amounting to about ten thousand marks, to
the deaconess society, asking only that she be
cared for for the remainder of her life. This sum
enabled the house to be built, and last summer it
was opened for use. It lies upon a mountain, has
a pleasant outlook to the south, and a beautiful view
over the valley of the Main and off to the distant
forests. Near at hand is a grove of chestnut trees,
and farther removed are extensive pine forests with<a
  id="png.122" name="png.122"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">122/</span>118</samp>
pleasant walks. The house is in the charge of one
of the older sisters.</p>

<p>The regulations touching the training and duties
of the sisters are similar to those of Kaiserswerth.
Two years of probation are required, part of which
is devoted to practical work under the superintendence
of an older deaconess. The rules of daily life
are much the same; a quiet half hour of prayer and
meditation is strongly urged, and the same freedom
in control of personal property and withdrawal from
the office exists. It is pleasant to record that our
deaconesses have secured to themselves such good
report for their usefulness that the city officials in
Germany accord to them the free use of steamboats
and street-cars; and the Prussian government does
the same for roads that are under State control.</p>

<p>The Bethany Society of the German Methodists is
self-supporting and is independent of the Conference,
save only that the board of direction is composed
of Methodist preachers chosen by the Conference.
Each of the homes at the five stations has also its
board of control, made up of the inspector, the pastor
in charge, and the head sister. The inspector is a
member of the Conference, but has no appointment,
as his whole time is devoted to the duty of superintendence.
Last year the society took the further
step of deciding that henceforth the deaconesses<a
  id="png.123" name="png.123"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">123/</span>119</samp>
should not be sent, as heretofore, to outside hospitals
or other institutions to complete their training,
but should be given the advantages they require
at our own homes. Owing to this decision only six
probationers can be received for the coming year,
and others who have made application to enter
must wait their turn.</p>

<p>The German Methodist Church, the daughter of
American Methodism, anticipated the parent Church
in utilizing the womanly gifts and services of deaconesses
as members of her aggressive forces, and
furnished it a very helpful and stimulating example.</p>

<h3 class="newchap">CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<h4>DEACONESSES IN PARIS.</h4>


<p><span class="smc">When</span> in Paris we visited the deaconess establishment
on the Rue de Reuilly, and had the pleasure,
ever to be remembered, of seeing the institution
in all its workings under the guidance of Mademoiselle
Sara Monod, the daughter of Adolphe
Monod; members of a family that have been Protestants
of the Protestants in the annals of France.
We examined with some degree of thoroughness
the different departments, and saw them in the
busy working hours, when the full activities of the
great establishment were in exercise.</p>

<p>In addition to the information and reports then
secured I am under further obligation to Mademoiselle
Monod for other material lately received,
among which is a pamphlet entitled <i>Une Visite à la
Maison de Diaconesses</i>, by Madame W. Monod, &ldquo;the
worthy daughter of one of the founders, and the
worthy wife of one of the present chaplains of the
institution.&rdquo; I have translated freely from this
in the following pages, as it is pervaded by a tone<a
  id="png.125" name="png.125"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">125/</span>121</samp>
of intimate knowledge, and nothing can take the
place of the long years of close personal relation
that make this little book so fresh and attractive
in its recital.</p>

<p>The institution is situated on the outskirts of the
Faubourg St. Antoine, upon an elevation, where the
view in one direction is limited by Mont St. Geneviève,
and on the other embraces a large territory
intersected by the windings of the Seine and by
lines of railroad. The space is thickly dotted by the
high chimneys of manufactories and massive constructions
of various forms. A great pile of buildings
which fronts upon the street forms one of the
sides of the court within; two long wings extend
at right angles, which seem to have been built at
different intervals of time. That on the right ends
with the penitentiary, or house of correction; the
left wing terminates more modestly at the garden
entrance; while farther, at the extreme portion of
the grounds, still to the left, rises the hospital,
standing apart from the rest. The whole establishment,
including the gardens, has an extent of fifty-five
hundred square meters.</p>

<p>In the little room at the entrance, where the
<i>concierge</i> is usually found in these French houses,
sits one of the sisters, surrounded by bell-cords and
tubes and bells which are constantly in use, bringing<a
  id="png.126" name="png.126"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">126/</span>122</samp>
messages to and fro in all directions. A sister
is always on duty, morning, afternoon, and at night
when it is necessary, responding with discreet politeness
to the inquiries made. Adjoining are the
little reception rooms, where comers and goers are
met, and the consulting-room of the distinguished
oculist, who twice a week gives gratuitously his
valuable services. Then come the office and reception-room
of the chaplain of the house, followed by
the little &ldquo;prophet&#8217;s chamber,&rdquo; occupied by the
former directress when she returns upon visits
which her age and poor health render only too infrequent.</p>

<p>What the French call the &ldquo;<i>économat</i>&rdquo; or business
office, next demands our attention. A dozen
registers admirably kept, portfolios of all kinds, and
numberless papers are arranged upon different
shelves. The sister in charge notes in her journal
every entrance and every departure, and all the journeys
and leaves of absence of the sisters. In a safe
she has the necessary money for current expenses,
the rest being deposited in the bank. She provides
the stores, examines the accounts of the pharmacy
and the kitchen, pays the salaried employees, gives
or sends to each deaconess the modest sum allowed
her for personal needs, and transacts the daily
business of the house. She must also every month<a
  id="png.127" name="png.127"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">127/</span>123</samp>
hand in three reports&mdash;one to the Prefect of Police,
another to the Minister of the Interior, and
the third to the Minister of Finance, giving detailed
statistics concerning the age, occupation, and progress
of her <i>protégés</i>. &ldquo;How many know how to
read? How many to read and write? How many
to read, write, and cipher? What progress has
been made since the last report?&rdquo; These are
some of the questions she has to answer; and,
meanwhile, if a crowd of little children come in, she
turns from her writing and calculations and plays
with them as if she had nothing else to do.</p>

<p>Let us see where these children come from.
Here is the &ldquo;Salle d&#8217;Asile,&rdquo; as it is called, with its
benches and chairs for the little ones, maps and
historical pictures suspended upon the walls, slates
and globes, and all the belongings of a school-room.
The sister who has directed this school
for thirty-five years has seen sons and daughters
succeed fathers and mothers. More than nineteen
hundred children have passed through her hands.
With what pride she showed us the copy-books,
and pointed out some particularly good compositions.
Hers was no perfunctory task; a mother
could not have displayed greater interest in her
children. The number of pupils varies from one
hundred and ten to one hundred and thirty, a little<a
  id="png.128" name="png.128"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">128/</span>124</samp>
less than half of them being Catholics. All kinds
of primary instruction are given, including gymnastics,
singing, and marching. Bible stories hold an
important place in this elementary teaching, even
those which are sometimes considered to be beyond
the reach of children; for there is nothing in any
other book to take their place. It is useless to
add that not only lessons are given, but shoes,
aprons, and garments of all kinds, some of the little
ones being clothed from head to foot by the institution.
Every day soup is distributed, ostensibly
to the poor and the ill-nourished, but practically
partaken of by all. Even during the siege of Paris
the soup continued to appear. It gradually became
less substantial, it is true, but still it was
soup.</p>

<p>From four to six o&#8217;clock the mothers and older sisters
and brothers, or perhaps some old lady who has
been engaged to have the care of several children,
come to take the little ones home. The influence of
these children is felt beyond the school-room; it is
a visible, constant force. Such a little girl has persuaded
her grandmother not to work on Sundays.
Another asks for a book that her father can read
aloud to the family. And similar instances could
be multiplied; they are always to be obtained
where loving Christian hearts are interested in<a
  id="png.129" name="png.129"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">129/</span>125</samp>
children, and when they remember that fine saying
of Jacqueline Pascal; &ldquo;<i>Parler à Dieu des petites
âmes plus qu&#8217; aux petites âmes de
Dieu.</i>&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.ix.1" name="fna.ix.1" id="fna.ix.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>There used formerly to be attached to this a
&ldquo;<i>Crèche</i>,&rdquo; where a mother could bring her babe
when she went to work in the morning, and could
come for it at night. But the government has now
started a day-home for this district of the city, so
this part of the work of the deaconesses has been
discontinued.</p>

<p>Passing by the vegetable garden, which is also a
pleasure garden for the sick and infirm, we come to
the hospital. This was opened in September, 1873,
and can accommodate sixty to seventy patients.
There are two large wards for women, one for children,
a dormitory for aged women, and rooms with
one, two, and three beds. All are perfectly heated,
lighted, and ventilated. The medical inspector
visits the house every month, and gives it due
praise for meeting every condition of modern medical
science.</p>

<p>A committee of ladies takes the hospital as an
especial object of its care. They have organized a
system of patronage, by which beds are furnished
poor patients at a low rate, in some cases<a
  id="png.130" name="png.130"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">130/</span>126</samp>
gratuitously. Fifteen subscribers give each two francs,
or forty cents, a month; the sick man or his patron
pays a franc a day, to which the Deaconess Home
adds also a franc daily. These three francs represent
the bare expenses of a hospital bed. Of course,
sixty cents a day is far from meeting the entire
cost of rent, food, baths, medicine, and service;
but those patients who have been accustomed to a
certain degree of comfort in life, when paying three
francs, are freed from the painful impression of receiving
charity.</p>

<p>Many of the patients, when sent forth from the
hospital, are directed to the Convalescents&#8217; Home,
at Passy. This is an inestimable benefit; what
could this poor servant do, whose strength is not
yet sufficient to undertake fatiguing labor? Or
this mother of a family, who would certainly fall ill
again if obliged to resume the heavy burden of
housekeeping, accompanied by privations and wearing
economies, were it not for the home at Passy?
Such homes of rest and convalescence are a necessity
in connection with every well-equipped
deaconess institution. The pharmacy is in the
charge of a deaconess trained especially for her
duties. A deaconess director, several nurse deaconesses
and probationers, with one or two aged
women, constitute the working force of the<a
  id="png.131" name="png.131"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">131/</span>127</samp>
hospital outside of the physicians. So many denominational
hospitals are now arising in America that
the arrangement of hospitals under the care of deaconesses
in Germany, France, and England, cannot
fail to have interest for us.</p>

<p>There are no nurses like the deaconesses. Other
nurses, however well prepared in the best of training-schools,
do not have the same high motive that
lifts the service onto the plane of religious duty,
where the question of self-interest is wholly lost
sight of. It was the perception of this truth that
led the authorities of the German Hospital in Philadelphia
to send to Germany for deaconesses as
nurses, and that has brought about the erection of
the magnificent Mary J. Drexel Home for Deaconesses.</p>

<p>But let us return to Paris and our examination
of the home on the Rue de Reuilly. Leaving the
hospital, and turning in the opposite direction from
that to which we came, we are at the house of
correction. Bars of iron before the windows apprise
us of the character of the building. There
are two divisions of inmates; the one in which the
discipline is more rigid is called the <i>retenue</i>.
Those placed here are generally between fourteen
and twenty-one years of age, although occasionally
a child of precocious depravity is met with, who has<a
  id="png.132" name="png.132"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">132/</span>128</samp>
to be separated from those under less restriction
even at ten years of age. The <i>disciplinaire</i> is
the division of milder restraint. The twenty-five
or twenty-six places in each of the two divisions
are ordinarily applied for in advance. Pastor Louis
Valette said: &ldquo;We shall not have room enough
until we have too much room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are three classes of inmates: those who
are put here by their parents for insubordination
or other grave faults; those who are sent here by
order of a judge of the court for a limited period,
and those who are recognized guilty of a misdemeanor,
but are acquitted on account of their age,
and must remain a certain time, sometimes until
they have attained their majority, in houses of correction
and education.</p>

<p>The Minister of the Interior pays twelve cents a
day for pupils of the third class; the Prefect of Police
four hundred dollars a year for those of the
second class, whatever their number, only the establishment
is bound to receive them at any time
and at any hour.</p>

<p>There is a system of rewards, to promote good
behavior, and those who profit by it can accumulate
a small sum of money, sometimes amounting to
sixteen or eighteen dollars, to have when they go
out from here. In other cases there is a large<a
  id="png.133" name="png.133"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">133/</span>129</samp>
indebtedness on the opposite side, which can never
be collected.</p>

<p>The days are occupied in household work, washing,
ironing, and sewing, and two hours of schooling.
When the nature of the work will permit, instructive
books are read aloud, or the deaconesses
give pleasant talks on different subjects that will
keep the thoughts of the workers busy, and give
them helpful ideas to store away in their minds.
As we went about in the sewing-classes, we noticed
that the time was invariably utilized in some way
that was profitable to the girls. Most of them are
pitiably ignorant of even the commonest knowledge
demanded in life. There are separate court-yards
for the recreations of the two divisions. The girls
of the <i>disciplinaire</i> are sometimes taken outside the
institution for walks; those of the <i>retenue</i>, never.
The work in this last division is especially difficult,
and requires the utmost patience and love. These
poor girls have to be watched carefully, and kept
isolated from one another. Some are greatly influenced
by the atmosphere of the place, the gentle,
firm kindness of the sisters, and the restriction they
receive. Others go out to take up again the old life
of immorality, and are dragged away into the meshes
of sin, finding their place, after brief delay, in the
wards of a hospital, or sometimes a suicide&#8217;s grave.<a
  id="png.134" name="png.134"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">134/</span>130</samp>
It is a singular fact that the numerical appreciation
of those influenced by this school of reform is precisely
the same as that given in the report of the
similar work at Kaiserswerth, although the two reports
have no connection with one another, and one
in no wise supposes the other. Thirty-three years
ago one of the founders of the institution, Pastor
Valette, said in answer to a question as to the
amount of good accomplished, &ldquo;Sixteen years ago
this question came to my ears, and I stated as a principle
that one cannot and ought not to answer it
precisely and absolutely, because no one but God
can give an appreciation of its real value. However,
out of curiosity, I set myself at work to gather
and register some results; and, matured by the experience
of six years, I offer them, such as they are:
One third of the moral results may be considered
excellent; another third as offering good guarantees,
and a final third has no value. It seems to
me, however, as I am sure it will seem to you, that
here is cause for rejoicing. Here is something for
which to praise the Lord, and to encourage those
who administer our affairs. For, I ask of the merchants
who listen to me, if any one were to offer
you thirty-three and one third per cent. assured,
with the hope of a dividend, would you refuse the
investment?&rdquo;</p>
<a id="png.135" name="png.135"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">135/</span>131</samp>

<p>In 1871 an occurrence took place worthy of being
recorded. On April 13, at ten o&#8217;clock in the evening,
emissaries of the Commune entered the house,
revolvers in hand. Armed men were posted at all
the entrances. The deaconesses were summoned
to one of the parlors, and held prisoners until three
o&#8217;clock the following morning. Meanwhile an investigation
took place among the girls in the penitentiary,
as they would be the most likely of any of
the inmates of the house to have complaints. The
officers of the Commune interrogated them closely.
Their answers were favorable beyond all expectation.
&ldquo;Are you happy here?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, yes, very
happy.&rdquo; &ldquo;What have you done deserving punishment?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nothing that we need talk to you
about.&rdquo; &ldquo;How are you punished here?&rdquo; &ldquo;The
sisters don&#8217;t punish us; they advise us what to do,
and warn us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the chief to one, &ldquo;just
tell me quietly, no one else need hear; if you are
not contented I will take you away with me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What a coward you are,&rdquo; she answered, quite
scornfully. Not one of them thought of escaping.
All this time the prison wagon had been waiting in
the street, and would have been filled with deaconesses
had the slightest cause of complaint been
found; but it went away empty. Later the sisters
had occasion to go to the head-quarters of the<a
  id="png.136" name="png.136"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">136/</span>132</samp>
Commune in their ward, and they met with polite
consideration. This is not the only experience of
the troubled <ins class="transcriber"
  title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'polititical'">political</ins> life of the great city that the
deaconesses have had. The Faubourg St. Antoine
has been noted ever since the time of the Fronde
as being the haunt of all that is turbulent and revolutionary.
In February 1848, a great barricade was
thrown across the Rue de Reuilly, men, women,
and children hurrying with bricks and stones to
help in building it. Then came the moment of
storm and attack, and forty-two men lay dead in
the <ins class="transcriber"
  title="Transcriber's note: period missing in original">street.</ins>
 Some of the wounded were received by
the sisters, crowded as they were with the children
whom the mothers had brought for safety. Meanwhile
the deaconesses went about unmolested,
bought food and medicine, hunted friends and relatives
for the sick, and through all that period of
excitement and strife kept up their ministrations of
mercy.</p>

<p>There is no distinct home for women who are left
alone and desire Christian surroundings, as is the
case in several German institutions, but about sixty
such ladies are received as boarders in the Paris
home. Frequently also the hospitality of the
house is enjoyed by young girls who come to Paris
alone to earn a livelihood, or who have to stop here
for some hours on their way to another place; a<a
  id="png.137" name="png.137"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">137/</span>133</samp>
great advantage for inexperienced young women,
unversed in the ways of a city, who find themselves
alone in the great world for the first time.</p>

<p>The preparatory school for deaconesses is on the
first floor, below the rooms of the sisters. For two
years the candidates are under the instruction of
superior sisters. They are received into the house
gratuitously, and accept its regulations while they remain.
They have to pass through all practical duties
of house-work, and care of the sick and children.
They also pursue practical and theoretical courses
in hygiene, and receive lessons in singing and pedagogics.
The chaplains of the institution give them
courses of religious instruction, and lectures on
Church history. Some (the larger number) need
very elementary lessons; others come with a good
education. Each is directed according to her education
and experience. In fact, all classes are represented
among the deaconesses; servants, teachers,
ladies, and shepherdesses. They come from
different parts of France, but in larger numbers
from the South.</p>

<p>Deaconesses are constantly in demand to go out
in the city as nurses in private families. Such requests
often meet with refusals, because sisters cannot
be spared for such duties. Their work is limited
by the smallness of their numbers. The last<a
  id="png.138" name="png.138"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">138/</span>134</samp>
report gives sixty deaconesses attached to the Home
on the Rue de Reuilly.</p>

<p>The work is upon sterile soil as compared to Germany.
The Protestants of France are in a small
minority, surrounded by an overwhelming majority
of Catholics; while in the beginning of the work
some influential members of the Protestant faith,
having an inadequate comprehension of the good in
the movement, and a misconception of its plans,
exerted a powerful influence that for awhile told
adversely to the cause. The home has now passed
beyond the stage when it can be affected by adverse
criticisms; and it to-day not only has the approbation
of Christians, but also of those who regard it
solely from the point of view of
philanthropy.<sup><a href="#fn.ix.2" name="fna.ix.2" id="fna.ix.2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>There are but two parish deaconesses who are at
work in Belleville and Ste. Marie. The directors
of the institution would be glad to increase the
number, as they regard the work of the sisters
under the direction of the city pastors as that
which presents the widest opportunities for doing
good, while it perpetuates those aspects of the deaconess
work which most closely resemble those of
the early Church. But Calvin&#8217;s reply from Geneva
to the Church of France is theirs. When petitioned<a
  id="png.139" name="png.139"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">139/</span>135</samp>
to send more pastors over the boundary into France
he replied, &ldquo;Send us wood and we will send you
arrows.&rdquo; So the want of deaconesses is a continual
hinderance to the furtherance of the cause, both in
the city and the provinces.</p>

<p>The prisons for women in France are under the
supervision of women, save the office of chief director,
which is filled by a man. The great majority
of the prisoners in France being Catholics, the number
of Sisters of Charity is naturally much larger
than the number of deaconesses employed. At the
prison of Clermont four of the Paris deaconesses
are kept constantly at work among the prisoners.</p>

<p>In connection with the old prison of St. Lazare,
the women&#8217;s prison of Paris, the deaconesses have
a mission especially concerned with caring for discharged
female convicts. As was the case at Kaiserswerth,
this, in its initiation, is closely connected
with the saintly life of Elizabeth Fry. When she
came to Paris, in 1835, a drawing-room meeting was
held at the residence of the Duchess de Broglie, in
which she told of her efforts to effect a reform in
prisons in England. None of the ladies of rank and
wealth who heard her were stirred to greater effort
than was demanded by the keen interest with which
they listened to her words; but a quiet governess
was present, Mademoiselle Dumas, and with her<a
  id="png.140" name="png.140"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">140/</span>136</samp>
the seeds of truth fell into prepared ground. She
determined to attempt for her own country a portion
of the work Mrs. Fry had accomplished for
England. Obtaining permission from the authorities
to visit the prison of St. Lazare, she went daily
to the prisoners shut up in the rooms of this great
building, formerly the monastery of St. Vincent de
Paul, the founder of the Sisters of Charity. After
the deaconess home was established, some deaconesses
were set apart to aid Mademoiselle Dumas in
her work. All these years the mission has continued,
not interrupted even during the dark days of
the Commune. A committee of ladies aids in
providing shelter and work for the prisoners when
they are discharged. The great publishing house
of Hachette &amp; Co., although the head of the firm
is a Catholic, provides employment in folding paper
for books.</p>

<p>Through the kind offices of Mademoiselle Monod
we called on Mademoiselle Dumas. She is now an
extremely aged woman; but her interest in the
Christian reformation of prisoners of her sex is as
keen as it was over fifty years ago, when her labors
began. The registers of many years stand by her
desk, and from these we were shown how the records
of the mission are kept, and in what way the
lives of those assisted are watched and followed for<a
  id="png.141" name="png.141"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">141/</span>137</samp>
years. Narratives of individual reformation were
related to us, and through the long correspondence
of many years she was enabled to tell us of those
who had turned to a better life and held to it permanently.
As she talked her eyes brightened, the
tones of her voice became stronger and clearer, her
manner more vivacious, and the years seemed to
slip from her. Finally, as if overcome by the memories
that the long retrospect had brought to her,
and thrilled by the recollections, of all this work
meant to her, she ended by exclaiming, &ldquo;O, my
dear St. Lazare!&rdquo; I looked at her astonished. I
had just come from the walls of the gloomy prison,
and the place had chilled me with horror as I walked
through its corridors, and read the stories of shame
and guilt in the faces of its inmates; most hopeless
looking faces, belonging to little children of ten and
twelve up to hardened and prematurely aged women
of fifty and sixty. I could not comprehend a term
of endearment applied to such a place. But a moment&#8217;s
consideration led me to see that this aged
saint had there fought and won the best of her
life&#8217;s battles, and the place remains glorified in her
thoughts by most hallowed and Christ-like memories.</p>

<p>Now that Mademoiselle Dumas is kept to her
room, the deaconesses still come to her weekly,<a
  id="png.142" name="png.142"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">142/</span>138</samp>
make their reports, and keep up the proper entries
in her books.</p>

<p>A recent letter from Mademoiselle Monod says:
&ldquo;Mademoiselle Dumas still lives, having completed
her ninety-sixth year the 26th of last December
(1888). Only yesterday our prison committee met
at her house, she acting as presiding officer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The life of this quiet woman is but little known
outside the circle of her immediate influence, but it
has been more valuable to her country than that of
many a general or statesman who has been ranked
among the famous of the earth.</p>

<p>The deaconess home has also branches of work
in different parts of France. These include nine
hospitals, two homes for the aged and infirm, four
orphanages, two work-rooms for young girls, and
a convalescents&#8217; home. The house has established
close connection with the deaconess houses at
St. Loup in French Switzerland, and with Strasburg.
The ties of a common language and former
memories are strong, and these are the homes most
akin to the Paris home.</p>

<p>The ordinary expenses of the Paris deaconess
home are about thirty thousand dollars a year.
Nearly seven thousand dollars are collected annually
by subscriptions, the remaining sum being
made up of returns arising from service.</p>
<a id="png.143" name="png.143"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">143/</span>139</samp>

<p>The institution was founded in 1841 by Rev.
Antoine Vermeil, a distinguished minister of the
Reformed Church, aided by a devout and worthy
minister of the Lutheran Church, Rev. Louis
Valette. It has grown up under the joint and harmonious
patronage of these two State Churches.</p>

<p>A later deaconess home, entirely devoted to training
and employing parish deaconesses, was started
in 1874, under the sole control of the Lutheran
Church. Some pastors secured the co-operation of
a few young Christian women to consecrate a portion
of their strength and time to the service of the
Church. From this beginning sprang the work that
exists to-day. The home is located in the Rue de
Bridaine. There are now sixteen deaconesses, six
of whom are probationers. Five of them are located
in different parishes in Paris, usually at a long distance
from the central house. Each goes forth
early in the morning to her parish, where is a room
of some kind serving as a center to the work. Materials
used in nursing and medicines are stored here,
and there is an office for the physician, who comes
at stated periods to give free consultation. From
the district house the deaconess goes in all directions
and in all weather to look up families which
have fallen away from the Church, to gather in children
for the Sunday-school, to visit the sick, and to<a
  id="png.144" name="png.144"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">144/</span>140</samp>
collect garments and money from the rich in order to
distribute them among the poor. Such are some
of their duties. Each sister is under the direction
of a pastor, and is aided by his advice, while still
remaining a member of the community to which
she belongs.</p>

<p>In both of the deaconess houses of Paris, as in
the German houses, a special service sets <ins class="transcriber"
  title="Transcriber's note: original has 'aparts'">apart</ins>
those sisters who have passed their period of probation,
and have been received into full connection.
As one of the deaconess reports beautifully says:
&ldquo;When Christ calls the soul to a special vocation
he gives it special grace, and those who consecrate
themselves to him he consecrates to their task by
the strength of his Spirit. So in conformity with
the usages of the primitive Church we give consecration
to our sisters by the laying on of hands.
The consecration is not a sacramental act, conferring
a particular character, greater sanctity, or special
powers; neither is it simply a ceremony or pious
formality. It is a real and efficacious benediction,
which the Saviour accords to our sisters to consecrate
them to their holy work, as he accorded it to
the deacons who received the imposition of the
apostles&#8217; hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The good that can be accomplished by deaconesses
working together with ministers in behalf of<a
  id="png.145" name="png.145"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">145/</span>141</samp>
the manifold interests of the Church is incalculable.
The most faithful pastor can make only short and
unsatisfactory visits. Many sorrows which he overlooks
the deaconess can discern and assuage. She
knows best how to reach the heart of a sorrowing
woman, to care for her needs, to discern her wants,
and to bring solace to the sorrowing and succor to
the needy. Deaconesses who have been specially
trained for service cannot be spared now that the
world has learned to know of them. For &ldquo;charity
cannot take the place of experience, nor good-will
replace knowledge;&rdquo; and trained Christian service
is the highest of all service.</p>

<p>The old spirit of the Huguenots has not died out
of France, and with that ready susceptibility to noble
ideas which is a marked characteristic of the
French character, we can expect to see the deaconess
cause thrive and prosper as it has done in other
lands.</p>

<h3 class="newchap">CHAPTER X.</h3>

<h4>DEACONESSES IN ENGLAND.</h4>


<p><span class="smc">To</span> learn the first facts about deaconesses in England,
we must go back to the early days of the
Puritans. In 1576, under Queen Elizabeth, about
sixty non-conformist ministers of the eastern counties
assembled to make regulations concerning
Church constitution and discipline, and one of
them was as follows: &ldquo;Touching deacons of both
sorts, namely, both men and women, the Church
should be admonished what is required by the apostle,
that they are not to choose men by custom or
course, or for their riches, but for their faith, zeal,
and integrity; and that the Church is to pray in the
meantime to be so directed that they may choose
them that are meet. Let the names of those that
are thus chosen be published the next Lord&#8217;s Day,
and after that their duties to the Church, and the
Church&#8217;s duty toward them. Then let them be received
into their office with the general prayers of
the whole Church.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.x.1" name="fna.x.1" id="fna.x.1">1</a></sup></p>
<a id="png.147" name="png.147"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">147/</span>143</samp>

<p>There are other references in the works of the
early Puritans that indicate that the office of deaconess
was as well known and recognized as were
the other offices that were named in accordance
with the usages of the primitive Church.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century it still
survived, as we shall see from a quaint and curious
picture that is of especial interest to all Americans,
because it portrays what took place in that community
of pious souls who furnished us the men we
delight to honor as the Pilgrim Fathers. A number
of these heroic souls, who could give up their country,
but would not yield their faith, went forth from
England in 1608, and settled in Amsterdam. They
preserved in a foreign land their own Church usages,
as the following words show: &ldquo;In Amsterdam there
were about three hundred communicants, and they
had for their pastor and teacher those two eminent
men before named (Johnson and Ainsworth); and
had at one time four grave men for ruling elders,
three able, godly men for deacons, and one ancient
widow for a deaconess, who did them service many
years, though she was sixty years of age when she
was chosen. She honored her place, and was an
ornament to the congregation. She usually sat in
a convenient place in the congregation, with a little
birchen rod in her hand, and kept little children in<a
  id="png.148" name="png.148"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">148/</span>144</samp>
awe from disturbing the congregation. She did
frequently visit the sick and weak, especially
women, and as there was need called out ladies and
young women to watch and do them other helps
as their necessity should require; and if there
were poor she would gather relief for them of those
that were able, or acquaint the deacons. And she
was obeyed as a mother in Israel and an officer of
Christ.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.x.2" name="fna.x.2" id="fna.x.2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Whether the &ldquo;ancient widow&rdquo; with the little
&ldquo;birchen rod&rdquo; had any followers in the early Puritan
communities of the Plymouth Colony we cannot
say, as there are no records that throw light on
the subject; but the history of early New England
Congregationalism gives us one indication that the
office was recognized in the New World. In the
Cambridge Platform, a system of Church discipline
agreed upon by the elders and messengers of the
New England churches assembled in synod at Cambridge,
in 1648, the seventh chapter enumerates the
duties of elder and deacons, and then adds, &ldquo;The
Lord hath appointed <i>ancient widdows</i>, where they
may be had, to minister in the Church, in giving
attendance to the sick, and to give succor unto<a
  id="png.149" name="png.149"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">149/</span>145</samp>
them and others in the like <ins class="transcriber"
  title="Transcriber's note: original has 'necessties'">necessities</ins>.&rdquo; The same
confusion of thought concerning the Church widow
and the deaconess is here seen, but there is evident
the recognition of the services that women were
officially to render the Church.</p>

<p>In the early part of the present century Southey
voiced the complaint, long reiterated, that Protestantism
had no missionaries. We who live in the
closing years of the same century, surrounded by
the multiplied evidences of the extent of missions,
when the Protestants of the world are expending
nearly ten millions of dollars annually, and employing
nearly six thousand men and women as missionaries,
cannot realize the change that has taken
place. In 1830 Southey again wrote: &ldquo;Thirty
years hence another reproach may also be effaced,
and England may have her Sisters of Charity.&rdquo;
He had learned to know their value when serving
as a volunteer in Wellington&#8217;s army, and a year
after the battle of Waterloo he had visited the Béguines
at Ghent, and what he saw deeply impressed
him. &ldquo;We should have such women among us,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;It is a great loss to England that we
have no Sisters of Charity. There is nothing Romish,
nothing unevangelical in such communities;
nothing but what is right and holy; nothing but
what belongs to that religion which the apostle<a
  id="png.150" name="png.150"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">150/</span>146</samp>
James has described as &lsquo;pure and undefiled before
God the Father.&rsquo;&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.x.3" name="fna.x.3" id="fna.x.3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Southey&#8217;s prophecy has come true. England to-day
in her deaconesses possesses her Sisters of
Charity. How has this change been brought about?
The acquaintance of Mrs. Fry with Fliedner, and
her visit to Kaiserswerth, led her to introduce into
England the practical training of nurses for the sick.
The Nursing Sisters&#8217; Institution in Devonshire
Square, Bishop&#8217;s Gate, was founded through her
efforts in 1840, and still exists &ldquo;to train nurses for
private families, and to provide pensions for aged
nurses.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.x.4" name="fna.x.4" id="fna.x.4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1842, Fliedner came to London, accompanied
by four sisters, at the invitation of the German
Hospital at Dalston. These deaconesses won
golden opinions from the hospital authorities for
their quiet, efficient manner, and their trained skill.
The hospital continues to be served by them, but
the Sisters now come from the mother house at
Darmstadt.</p>

<p>Kaiserswerth and its deaconesses became more
widely known through the life and inestimable services
of Florence Nightingale. When a child, one<a
  id="png.151" name="png.151"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">151/</span>147</samp>
of Fliedner&#8217;s reports fell into her hands. Its perusal
marked an era in her life. It made clear to her what
she should do. She would go to Kaiserswerth, and
fit herself for a nurse. Her childish resolve never
wavered. &ldquo;Happy is the man who holds fast to
the ideals of his youth.&rdquo; Florence Nightingale held
fast to hers. She went to Kaiserswerth at two different
times, and through her deeds and her writings
the care of the sick in England has been completely
transformed. She has won a nation&#8217;s gratitude,
and now is living in honored old age in one
of the London institutions founded mainly by the
money that she contributed, and which she obtained
by selling some valuable gifts given her by a foreign
government in acknowledgment of her care of its
wounded soldiers during the Crimean war.</p>

<p>Another woman distinguished in England&#8217;s philanthropies
is Agnes Jones, who left a home of
wealth and refinement to receive her training also
at Kaiserswerth. Returning to England she gave
her time and talents in single-hearted devotion to
the care of the poor in the Liverpool work-house,
and met death in the midst of her labors. The
training which led two such women to accomplish
such noble deeds naturally was recognized as valuable,
and Kaiserswerth soon became an honored
name in England.</p>
<a id="png.152" name="png.152"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">152/</span>148</samp>

<p>In 1851 Miss Nightingale sent out anonymously
her little book entitled <i>An Account of the Institution
of Deaconesses</i>, which added to the knowledge already
in circulation about the movement in Germany.
Meanwhile articles were appearing in the
reviews. In 1848 one was written in the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i> by John Malcolm Ludlow, who later,
in 1866, gave the results of the thoughts and studies
of a number of years in <i>Woman&#8217;s Work in the
Church</i>, the best historical study of the subject up
to the date at which it was written. Since then the
Germans have pushed their historical investigations
further, and the work needs to be revised and to be
brought down to the present time.</p>

<p>In <i>Good Words</i> for 1861 there were two articles by
Dr. Stevenson, of the Irish Presbyterian Church,
entitled &ldquo;The Blue Flag of Kaiserswerth,&rdquo; afterward
incorporated in his work, <i>Praying and Working</i>, a
book too little known among us.</p>

<p>The great upholder of the deaconess cause in the
Church of England was the late Dean of Chester,
Rev. J. S. Howson. His essay, first published in
the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, was amplified and issued
in book form in 1860 under the title <i>Deaconesses</i>.
It won many friends. The cause remained a
favorite one with him, and he constantly advocated
it by speech and by deed. Since his death<a
  id="png.153" name="png.153"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">153/</span>149</samp>
his latest thoughts, which remained substantially
the same as those that he first advanced, have
been published in a work entitled <i>The Diaconate of
Women</i>.</p>

<p>Within the Church of England, however, the deaconess
cause has not met the same prosperous development
that it has obtained in connection with
certain independent institutions, notably that of
Mildmay.</p>

<p>Among the institutions on the Continent, as well
as in the pages of this work up to the present, the
terms &ldquo;sister&rdquo; and &ldquo;deaconess&rdquo; are used synonymously,
to indicate one and the same person. But
when we come to consider the deaconess institutions
within the Church of England we cannot continue
to use these two names in the same way. A deaconess
is a member of a deaconess institution, actively
engaged in charitable deeds, but, like the deaconess
on the Continent, she can sever her connection
with it when adequate cause presents itself, and return
to her family and friends. A sister belongs to
a sisterhood which closely resembles the Roman
Catholic sisterhoods in many features. These sisterhoods
began in 1847 with a number of ladies
brought together through the influence of Dr. Pusey,
who formed themselves into a community to
live under its rule. Their influence and number<a
  id="png.154" name="png.154"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">154/</span>150</samp>
increased, and twenty-three sisterhoods are mentioned
in the last official report.<sup><a href="#fn.x.5" name="fna.x.5" id="fna.x.5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Doubtless it was the activity and great usefulness
of the continental deaconess houses that provided
the stimulating examples which acted on the Church
of England and led to the rise of sisterhoods and
deaconess institutions. But the two opposing tendencies
within the Episcopal Church&mdash;namely, that
which desires to approach the Church of Rome,
with which it feels itself in sympathy on many
points, and that which views with disfavor any conformity
to it, and strives to keep to the landmarks set
at the great Reformation&mdash;these two distinct tendencies
are closely reflected in the woman&#8217;s work of
the Anglican Church.<sup><a href="#fn.x.6" name="fna.x.6" id="fna.x.6">6</a></sup>
The sisterhoods are distinctly
under the fostering care of the former element,
the deaconesses are manifestly favored by the
latter. Sisterhoods, again, differ among themselves,
some being strongly conventual in their life and
practice, adopting the three vows of poverty, chastity,
and obedience, and a few even advocating penance
and confession. The vows are taken for life,
and, in connection with the view of the sacred obligation
to life-long service, great stress is laid upon
the position of the sister as the &ldquo;bride of Christ&rdquo;&mdash;the<a
  id="png.155" name="png.155"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">155/</span>151</samp>
same thought of the mysterious union with
the heavenly Bridegroom that is so dwelt upon in
the nunneries of the Catholic Church. With such
views Protestants, distinctly such, can have no
sympathy. Those who look upon the deaconess
as a valuable member of the Church economy do
so because they regard her as a Christian woman,
strengthened and disciplined by special training to
do better service for Christ in the world. This is
the recognized difference: &ldquo;The sisterhood exists
primarily for the sake of forming a religious community,
but deaconesses live together for the sake
of the work itself, attracted to deaconess work by
the want which in most populous towns is calling
loudly for assistance; and with a view of being
trained, therefore, for spiritual and temporal usefulness
among the poor.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.x.7" name="fna.x.7" id="fna.x.7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>There are now seven deaconess establishments in
the Church of England, each having a larger or
smaller number of branches, with diocesan sanction
and under the supervision of clergymen.<sup><a href="#fn.x.8" name="fna.x.8" id="fna.x.8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>The first of these was founded in 1861, and is
now known as the London Diocesan Deaconess
Institution. At that time Kaiserswerth was<a
  id="png.156" name="png.156"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">156/</span>152</samp>
accepted as its model; deaconesses were sent there
to be trained; Kaiserswerth rules were adopted as
far as possible, and a modification of the Kaiserswerth
dress for the sisters. The house was then
represented at the triennial Conferences in Germany,
and in the list of mother houses published
at Kaiserswerth<sup><a href="#fn.x.9" name="fna.x.9" id="fna.x.9">9</a></sup>
the name still appears. It would
seem, however, that now the Kaiserswerth connection
is entirely set aside by the London house, for in
an historical sketch of the revival of deaconesses in
the Church, that is found in the organ of the institution,
called <i>Ancilla Domini</i>, for March, 1887, there
is no mention made of any of the continental houses.
The Anglican Church apparently dates the entire
work from the setting apart of its first deaconess,
Elizabeth C. Ferard, in 1861, as she was the first to
receive consecration through the touch of a bishop&#8217;s
hand. The former connection with Kaiserswerth
and the great work carried on in Germany
from 1836 to the present time are quite ignored.</p>

<p>Besides the London house already mentioned an
East London deaconess home was opened in 1880,
to provide deaconesses and church-workers for East
London. Besides the deaconesses and probationers
thirty-two associates are connected with this home.
The associates are ladies who do not intend to<a
  id="png.157" name="png.157"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">157/</span>153</samp>
become deaconesses, but give as much time as they
can to the work. They live with the deaconesses,
conform to the rules, and wear the garb, but pay
their own expenses. These associates are a highly
important part of the working force. They form a
valuable tie connecting the sisters with sources of
influence and aid that would otherwise be closed to
them. Nearly always they are ladies of independent
means, and come for longer or shorter periods
to relieve the deaconesses, their zeal often being as
great as that of the sisters whose places they take.</p>

<p>Besides these houses there are homes located at
Maidstone, Chester, Bedford, Salisbury, and Portsmouth,
in the respective dioceses of Canterbury,
Chester, Ely, Salisbury, and Winchester.</p>

<p>In the home at Portsmouth sisters not only engage
in nursing and parish work, but are also given
special training for penitentiary and out-of-door
rescue work. They also have a home for the rescue
of neglected children.</p>

<p>The Salisbury Home is beautifully situated in
the quiet cathedral city of the same name. The
house is a picturesque and venerable mansion, covered
with clinging green vines, opening out into a
garden which in olden times belonged to the convent.
There is in connection with the home an institution
for training girls for domestic service,<a
  id="png.158" name="png.158"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">158/</span>154</samp>
supported by the funds of a charity given for that purpose.
The whole service of the house is done by
the girls. They attend upon the deaconesses and
the ladies who board there to receive training in
the hospital. Each deaconess pays for board and
lodging while training, and, if able to do so, when
she returns for rest, or a visit to her old home.</p>

<p>In other houses the deaconess is expected to
keep her own room in order, and may have some
duties in the house, but servants do the rough
work. The social status of the English deaconesses
is, as a rule, markedly different from the
German deaconesses. Here ladies of rank and
inherited social traditions, of refinement, of accomplishments,
and of education, many of them women
of means, defraying their entire expenses and often
those of their poorer sisters, are largely represented
among the deaconesses. On the other hand, the
German deaconesses, as we have seen, are largely
of that station in life that furnishes many for domestic
service. Although of course there are among
them women of all ranks and all degrees of education,
still such women form the larger number;
and the conditions under which Fliedner began the
work, as well as the difference of custom and habit
in the two countries, incline the German houses
to maintain the rules of service by which nearly<a
  id="png.159" name="png.159"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">159/</span>155</samp>
every detail of domestic service in their institutions
is cared for by the deaconesses. There is
more of ceremony and formality in the English
deaconess institutions which are under the direction
of the Church of England. At Salisbury, for instance,
the candidate must reside in the home for
three months, that her ability and efficiency may be
tested. If accepted, she then puts on a gray serge
habit, a leathern girdle, white cap, black bonnet,
the veil and cloak of a probationer, and is admitted
to the &ldquo;degree&rdquo; of a probationer at a special service.
The year of probation having come to an
end, she is again presented to the bishop, and is
set apart as a deaconess by the laying on of hands.
This time the habit is changed from gray to blue,
and a black ebony cross, with one of gold inlaid, is
hung upon her neck.<sup><a href="#fn.x.10" name="fna.x.10" id="fna.x.10">10</a></sup></p>

<p>This is very different from the way in which
Fliedner regarded the dress and adornment of the
deaconesses for whom he was responsible. The
king of Prussia desired to present them with a
small silver cross as their badge of service, but the
simple-hearted German pastor dissuaded him, saying
that the deaconesses needed no ornament save
a meek and quiet spirit, and they must avoid symbols
which would suggest Romish imitations.</p>
<a id="png.160" name="png.160"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">160/</span>156</samp>

<p>The Strasburg deaconesses also at first wore a
small cross, but Pastor Härter discontinued it when
he found that the wearing of it gave occasion for
complaint.</p>

<p>Yet however we may differ in the lesser details,
of garb, of rules, and of ceremonies, from those
accepted by some of the Church of England deaconess
institutions, we can give unstinted admiration
to the lives of self-denial, and active, unceasing
efforts in behalf of others, that we see among their
numbers. Take, for instance, the little publication
<i>The Deaconess</i>, issued by the East London Home,
and notice the undertakings carried on by the
members&mdash;district-visiting, nursing of the sick,
mothers&#8217; meetings, Sunday-school teaching, Bible
classes, and all the multitudinous ways of meeting
the squalor, poverty, ignorance, sickness, and
sin of the poor of the east of London. There is
no poetic enthusiasm that strengthens one for such
work, the dirt, the degradation, the forlorn condition
are so trying. The little children so precociously
wicked, so preternaturally cunning, that the
natural charm and attraction of childhood have
wholly disappeared; the sights and sounds that
assail the senses; the dulled, hopeless faces, the
apathy, the stunted intellectual growth&mdash;these are
the depressing influences that continually beset the<a
  id="png.161" name="png.161"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">161/</span>157</samp>
deaconesses, and nothing short of God-given
strength and Christ-like enthusiasm can enable these
women to devote six, eight, and ten years of service
to this worst city district, and to come forth with sunshiny,
peaceful faces, and sympathetic, loving hearts.</p>

<p>Taking the total number of deaconess institutions
under the Church of England, there are
eighty one deaconesses, thirty-four probationers,
and two hundred and twenty-nine associates.<sup><a href="#fn.x.11" name="fna.x.11" id="fna.x.11">11</a></sup></p>

<p>So far, sisterhoods have proved more attractive
to the women of the Church of England than have
deaconess establishments. The latter do not seem
to increase largely in numbers. Vexing questions
have arisen as to how the deaconess should be set
apart to her work. Should she be consecrated
by the imposition of the bishop&#8217;s hands? What
relation should she have to the Church? These
questions have been partially settled by the principles
and rules that were drawn up in 1871 and
were signed by the two archbishops and eighteen
bishops. They define a deaconess as &ldquo;a woman
set apart by a bishop, under that title, for service
in the Church;&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.x.12" name="fna.x.12" id="fna.x.12">12</a></sup>
placing her under the authority<a
  id="png.162" name="png.162"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">162/</span>158</samp>
of the bishop of the diocese. These recommendations
have not been formally adopted by the
Church of England; they hold good only so far as
they are accepted.</p>

<p>But there are other institutions, lying outside
of the boundaries of the State Church, which have
developed more fully and prosperously than those
within it. Of these we must speak first of the institution
of Dr. Laseron, which is more closely connected
with Kaiserswerth than any other in England.
In 1855 Dr. Laseron and his wife lost their only
child; and as Mrs. Laseron walked through the
streets with burdened heart she looked at the little
children with quickened sympathy, and noticed how
many were poor and hungry and scantily clothed.
She talked with her husband, and they opened a
&ldquo;ragged school&rdquo; for children. This increased and
branched off, until now there is an orphanage,
workhouses for boys, and a servants&#8217; training school
for girls. Requests were frequently made for some
of the older girls to act as nurses among the poor;
and, finally, Dr. Laseron, who was a German by
birth, determined to found a deaconess house and
hospital. A small hospital of twelve beds was
opened, and proved insufficient to meet the demands;
and none could be accepted as deaconesses,
as there was no opportunity to train them in so<a
  id="png.163" name="png.163"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">163/</span>159</samp>
small a place. While waiting to see how the house
could be enlarged, he mentioned his perplexity to
Mr. Samuel Morley. This gentleman heard him
with interest, and said that he was one of the directors
of a large hospital; that at a recent meeting
of the directors a Catholic bishop had offered to
send Sisters of Charity who, without compensation,
should nurse the sick, and he had thought what
a fine thing it would be if the Protestant Church
had also its women of piety who could devote themselves
to a similar work. The result of the conversation
was that Mr. Morley contributed forty
thousand dollars, with which Dr. Laseron purchased
a site in Tottenham, built a hospital with fifty beds,
and a deaconess was called from Kaiserswerth to
superintend it. The hospital has been again enlarged,
so that it now accommodates one hundred
patients. Sixty-four deaconesses are connected
with it, who are at service in the hospitals of Cork,
Dublin, Scarborough, and Sunderland. This institution
is unsectarian, and has met with special aid
from non-conformists. It still keeps in close relation
to Kaiserswerth, and is represented at the
Conferences. It has constantly thriven, and the
mother-house at Tottenham is a center for various
benevolent enterprises.</p>

<p>In connection with Dr. Barnardo&#8217;s Orphanage<a
  id="png.164" name="png.164"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">164/</span>160</samp>
there is also a deaconess house. Harley House,
the missionary training-school under the direction
of Dr. and Mrs. Grattan Guinness in East London,
has a deaconess home as one of its branches.
The Kilburn (St. Augustine&#8217;s) Orphanage of Mercy,
and the London Bible-women&#8217;s Mission are also
centers for the training and organizing of women&#8217;s
work in London.</p>

<p>We must pause more at length over the prison
mission under the care of Mrs. Meredith. American
women are beginning to occupy themselves
with questions of philanthropy and religious activity
to an extent not before equaled. The women&#8217;s
prisons in England are especially fruitful of suggestions
to us, as many here are interested in having
our women prisoners separated in prisons by
themselves, as has already been attempted in a few
States. Mrs. Meredith&#8217;s work is in behalf of the
prisoners after they have served their sentence and
are discharged. She is the daughter of General
Lloyd, who was formerly governor-general of prisons
in Ireland. As a little child she was accustomed
to go about with her father, and the interior
of prisons became familiar to her. Later in life,
when her family ties were broken, and her hands
left free for service, her interest was engaged in behalf
of the women convicts who were discharged<a
  id="png.165" name="png.165"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">165/</span>161</samp>
from prison. She enlisted the support of other
ladies of like views, able to assist her, and in 1866
the Prison Gate Mission began, which has continued
to the present day. Every morning, as the gate of
Millbank prison swings back to allow those who have
been released from penal bondage to come forth, a
sister stands waiting to invite those who will go
with her to a room near by, where breakfast awaits
them; there are ladies to inquire about their plans
and to offer them work. A great laundry was
opened in 1867 to provide employment for these
women. Here washing is done for two classes: for
the poor and sick, to whom the service is given as
a charity, and to those who pay for the work and
whose money enables the mission to be partly self-supporting.
Then the ladies extended their plans
to take in the children of the prisoners. A law was
passed by Parliament which enabled Mrs. Meredith
and her associates to have the care of those children
at the Princess Mary Village Home until they are
sixteen years of age. This home was founded at
Addlestone in 1870, and was named after the Princess
Mary, Duchess of Teck, who aided in obtaining
funds to build it. The institution takes not
only the female children of criminal mothers, but
also little girls who are likely to drift into a career
of crime. It is conducted on the cottage plan, each<a
  id="png.166" name="png.166"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">166/</span>162</samp>
little house having ten inmates and a house mother
to superintend it, and being complete in its own
arrangements. There are eighteen cottages, a large,
generous school-room, a small infirmary for the sick,
and a little church. About two hundred children of
criminals and the unfortunate class are here cared
for. Instead of allowing them to drift away and to
perpetuate vice, crime, and immorality, they are
taken entirely from their old surroundings, and new
influences of knowledge and purity are thrown
about them. There is no part of Mrs. Meredith&#8217;s
mission which has such hope for the future and is
so valuable in results as this preventive work among
the children.</p>

<p>There are also a woman&#8217;s medical mission (1882), a
Christian woman&#8217;s union, a girls&#8217; school, and a deaconess
house in Jerusalem under the control of the
same association. How it arose is well intimated by
the following extract from a letter from Mrs. Meredith
to the author, dated March 9, 1889: &ldquo;You will
know that my course has been progressive with regard
to the mode of congregating the women who
joined me in working. At first we merely came together
daily from our own homes, as those who
make a business concern do. Then to spare time
and money we began to live together. The next
step was to admit useful and devoted women who<a
  id="png.167" name="png.167"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">167/</span>163</samp>
had no property, and to form an association with
degrees of membership. When we found ourselves
becoming a corporation of importance, and having
combined to acquire property and to found institutions,
we invited the help and counsel of some
men of known eminence. Our institutions are all
branches of a parent stock, and are now placed
in the charge of these good men, and we have
taken the name of the Church of England Woman&#8217;s
Missionary Association. I am daily persuaded of
the value of such organizations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In connection with the London West Central
Mission there is an association of ladies called the
Sisters of the People. &ldquo;They are expected to be
worthy of the beautiful name they bear. They are
true sisters of the unprivileged and the disheartened;
as ready to make a bed, cook a dinner, or
nurse a baby as to minister to the higher need of
the immortal spirit. The sisters live together in
the neighborhood of their work, and wear a distinctive
dress as a protection and for other reasons; but
they take no vows, and are at liberty to withdraw
from the mission at any time. Their work is directed
by Mrs. Hughes. Katherine House, the
residence of the Sisters of the People, was opened
early in November, 1887, and from that day the
work of the sisters dates its commencement. Their<a
  id="png.168" name="png.168"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">168/</span>164</samp>
daily labors are very similar to those of the deaconesses
of Mildmay, who work among the London
parishes. Each sister has a district allotted to her,
which she visits regularly and systematically. The
first object which she sets before herself is to get
to know the people, and to make them feel that she
is their true sister and friend, irrespective of the
fact that they are themselves good or bad, respectable
or degraded. When once true friendliness is
established, the way is opened for direct religious
influence; and many, who in the first instance would
never pay any attention to religion, will listen to
an appeal from one whom they love and
respect.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.x.13" name="fna.x.13" id="fna.x.13">13</a></sup></p>

<p>Katherine House accommodates twelve sisters.
A second house is urgently needed, and a strong
plea is made for it in the Report.</p>

<p>There are besides &ldquo;out sisters,&rdquo; who work with the
sisters but reside at their own homes. This is a
valuable feature of this mission, as it interests ladies
who are living in their own homes, and yet who can
be very useful to those who devote their whole
work to the sisters&#8217; labor. In the Report a great
many instances are given which show what an intimate
knowledge of the poor people is obtained by
these sisters, and in what practical ways they<a
  id="png.169" name="png.169"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">169/</span>165</samp>
minister to the bodily and spiritual needs of those
whom they find in their house-to-house visitations.
The term &ldquo;sister,&rdquo; as it is used in the report of
the London West Central Mission, is in all respects
a synonym for &ldquo;deaconess,&rdquo; as the name is understood
in the large deaconess establishment at
Mildmay. To the study of this we shall devote
the following chapter.</p>

<h3 class="newchap">CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<h4>MILDMAY INSTITUTIONS.</h4>


<p><span class="smc">Valuable</span> suggestions will be obtained from the
study of every successful deaconess institution, and
none will perhaps furnish more practical models for
American Methodism than does the establishment
at Mildmay Park in North London. Its methods
of work are flexible, and allow place for a diversity
of talent among the workers, while a wide variety
of charitable and evangelistic effort is undertaken.
These two causes give a breadth and vigor to the
work at Mildmay that impress every one who has
knowledge of it.</p>

<p>Whenever we find a good cause carried on successfully
and prosperously, we know that behind it
there must be a strong man or woman who has
&ldquo;thought and wrought&rdquo; to good purpose. So the
first question that arises in the mind of the visitor
who for the first time forms one of the audience in
the great Conference Hall, or looks about in the
adjoining building to see the deaconess home, is,
&ldquo;Who first thought this out? Who was the founder<a
  id="png.171" name="png.171"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">171/</span>167</samp>
of this wonderful mission?&rdquo; And the answer tells
us that Mildmay originated, as did Kaiserswerth, in
the prayerful determination of a Christian minister
and his wife to reach out to every good end that
God&#8217;s spirit of enlightenment could suggest to
them. Rev. William Pennefather was rector of
Christ&#8217;s Church at Barnet, and while devoted to his
ministerial duties his sympathies did not end with
his own people, nor his own denomination. His
home was sometimes called the &ldquo;Missing Link,&rdquo; for
it was a meeting-place for noblemen and farmers,
bishops and clergymen of all churches; a place
&ldquo;where nationalities and denominations were easily
merged in the broad sunshine of Christian
love.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xi.1" name="fna.xi.1" id="fna.xi.1">1</a></sup>
He carried his principle of Christian fellowship
further, for, after mature deliberation, in 1856, he
issued a call for a conference to be held at Barnet
whose object was &ldquo;to bring into closer social communion
the members of various Churches, as children
of the one Father, animated by the same life,
and heirs together of the same glory.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xi.2" name="fna.xi.2" id="fna.xi.2">2</a></sup> These conferences
have been continued from then to the
present time, and are known and prized in many
lands. I was present at the conference of 1888,
and representatives were there from nearly every<a
  id="png.172" name="png.172"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">172/</span>168</samp>
Protestant country, while on the platform were
leaders of nearly every Protestant denomination,
furnishing a wonderful illustration of the union
of the Christian Church in Christ; a spiritual union
so real and eternal that the minor differences of
faith were swallowed up in the great fact that in
Christ Jesus all are one.</p>

<p>Gradually a variety of missionary and evangelistic
agencies grew up about the conferences. In 1860
the little Home was opened at Barnet which subsequently
developed into the deaconess house at
Mildmay Park. The question of calling into more
active exercise the energies of educated Christian
women, as we have seen in the preceding chapter,
was one that was attracting attention at the time
in England. Mr. and Mrs. Pennefather had long
desired to do something in this direction, and their
desire took this practical form. In its beginning it
had to battle with all the &ldquo;definite and indefinite
objections&rdquo; that could be advanced against any
attempt at organizing woman&#8217;s work. But those
days of latent suspicion or more open antagonism
are long past. The institution has justified its
right to be by doing a work that otherwise would
have remained undone.</p>

<p>In 1864 Mr. Pennefather was called to St. Jude&#8217;s,
Mildmay Park, and the philanthropic and religious<a
  id="png.173" name="png.173"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">173/</span>169</samp>
undertakings which he had begun were transferred
to his new home. He took with him the &ldquo;iron
room&rdquo; that had been erected for the conferences
at Barnet, and continued to use it for the same purposes
at Mildmay; while the missionary training-school
and home were accommodated in a house
which he hired for the purpose.</p>

<p>His new parish was in a part of London where
poverty and want abounded. There was no adequate
provision for the education of the poor and
neglected children, so he erected a building where
elementary instruction could be given at a very low
price. A soup-kitchen was started at the iron
room: clubs of various kinds were formed, and
other agencies were set at work, both for the temporal
and spiritual welfare of the people. The
degraded and miserable neighborhood gradually
underwent a transformation, and the police testified
that there was a manifest restraint on the lawless
locality. &ldquo;To many of the waifs of life no human
hand was stretched in kindness until he came to
the district and taught them what Christianity
was.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xi.3" name="fna.xi.3" id="fna.xi.3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>A small legacy coming to him, he bought a house
with a large garden attached, and made it a mission
center for the needs of the infirm and aged; while<a
  id="png.174" name="png.174"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">174/</span>170</samp>
the ignorant and careless, who would not enter a
church, were often induced to attend meetings
here.</p>

<p>The training-school had been started at Barnet
for the purpose of training foreign missionaries;
but Mr. Pennefather now saw that there was as
great a demand for home mission workers in the
sorrowful and benighted portions of the vast metropolis,
so, after much deliberation and consultation
between himself and his wife, he decided to
initiate the ministry of Christian women as deaconesses.
He hesitated about the name to be given to
the women whom he employed as Christian workers,
but no other was suggested conveying the
same idea of service to Christ among his suffering
and needy ones, and, as the appellation had already
won respect through the good reports of the deaconess
houses on the Continent, he decided to adopt
the same name. They continued to work in his
parish only until the terrible visitation of the
cholera in 1866. Then when men were swept into
eternity by hundreds, and hundreds more were in
dire distress, the deaconesses were invited by the
minister of another parish to come to his assistance.
In this way the bounds of the work began to
enlarge. A small hospital was added to the home
and a medical-school mission was begun.</p>
<a id="png.175" name="png.175"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">175/</span>171</samp>

<p>It now became necessary to build a large hall;
the iron room was too small for the conferences,
the church too small for the congregation, and the
missions had outgrown the capacity of the mission
room. When the plan for a new building was made
known money came in unsolicited from various
sources. The undertaking was pushed rapidly forward,
and in October, 1870, the hall was opened.
It will seat 2,500 people, having a platform at the
west end, and a gallery running around the sides
and east end.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving and prayer were built into the walls
from the very foundation; and before the basement
rooms were cleared of rubbish, or the floor laid, a
prayer-meeting was held to ask for a blessing upon
the future undertakings of the mission. The basement
was divided into five rooms, to be used for
night-schools and other agencies for the benefit of
the poor.</p>

<p>Adjoining the hall, at the west end, was built the
deaconess house. From his home near by Mr.
Pennefather had watched the completion of the
work with great interest. In one of his letters he
says:<sup><a href="#fn.xi.4" name="fna.xi.4" id="fna.xi.4">4</a></sup>
&ldquo;Sometimes I can scarcely believe that it
is a reality, and not all a dream&mdash;the Conference
Hall, with its appendages, and the deaconess house<a
  id="png.176" name="png.176"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">176/</span>172</samp>
actually in existence. May the Holy Spirit fill the
place, and may he make it a center from whence the
living waters shall flow forth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From a letter written to one of these deaconesses,
we gain his opinion as to the need of deaconesses,
and what was his ideal of a Home.<sup><a href="#fn.xi.5" name="fna.xi.5" id="fna.xi.5">5</a></sup>
&ldquo;The need
for such an institution is great indeed. I do not
suppose there was ever a time in the history of
Christianity in which the openings for holy, disciplined,
intelligent women to labor in God&#8217;s vineyard
were so numerous as at present. The population
in towns and rural districts are waiting for
the patient and enduring love that dwells in the
breast of a truly pious woman, to wake them up to
thought and feeling. O! if I had the women and
had the means, how gladly would I send out hundreds,
two by two, to carry the river of truth into
the hamlets of our country, and the streets and
lanes of our great cities. Will you pray for the
Home? Ask for women and for means. I want
our Home to be such a place of holy, peaceful memories
that, when you leave it, it may be among the
brightest things that come to your mind in a distant
land, or in a different position; and each inmate
can help to make it what it should be.&rdquo; But Mr.
Pennefather did not live to see the great extension<a
  id="png.177" name="png.177"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">177/</span>173</samp>
in usefulness and importance that the Deaconess
Home was to obtain in later years. He passed
away from life April 28, 1873, leaving to his wife,
who had ever been his sympathetic and devoted
helper, the care of continuing the work he had begun.
She is still the head of the Mildmay Institutions,
assisted by a resident superintendent, and
aided by the counsels of wise, experienced men, who
form the board of trustees.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the erection of the new
building every portion of it was put to use. In one
of the basement rooms is the invalid kitchen, where,
daily, puddings, jellies, and little delicacies are prepared
and sent out to sufferers in the neighborhood,
who could not otherwise obtain suitable nourishment.
From eleven to two o&#8217;clock tickets are
brought in, which have been distributed by the sisters
or by the district visitors; and those who come
to take the dinners, while waiting their turn, have
a kind word, or sympathetic inquiry about the sick
one, from the deaconess in charge.</p>

<p>A flower mission occupies another room. Kind
friends send here treasures from the garden and
green-house, field and wood, and children contribute
bouquets of wild flowers. A deaconess superintends
the willing hands that tie the bunches, each
of which is adorned with a brightly colored Scripture<a
  id="png.178" name="png.178"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">178/</span>174</samp>
text. Ten hospitals and infirmaries were regularly
visited during 1888; and more than thirty-eight
thousand bunches of flowers were distributed,
each accompanied by an appropriate text.</p>

<p>Near at hand is the Dorcas room, where deaconesses
are kept busy in cutting out clothing and superintending
the sewing classes. During the winter
of 1887 thirty widows attended this class three
times a week, glad to earn a sixpence by needlework
done in a warm, lighted room, while a deaconess
entertained them by reading aloud. A large
amount of sewing is given out from the same room,
and the garments that are made are often sold to
the poor at a low price. A most impressive scene
is witnessed during the winter months, when, on
three evenings of the week, all the basement rooms
are crowded with the men&#8217;s night-school, which has,
it is believed, no rival in England. The ordinary
number of names on the books exceeds twelve hundred.
There are forty-nine classes, all taught by
ladies, the majority of them being deaconesses.
The subjects range from the elementary to the
higher branches of general and practical knowledge,
including arithmetic, geography, geometry, freehand
drawing, and short-hand. The Bible is read in
the classes on Monday and Friday, and a scriptural
address is given by some gentleman on Wednesday.<a
  id="png.179" name="png.179"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">179/</span>175</samp>
The school always closes with prayer and singing.
The men may purchase coffee and bread and butter
before leaving, and of this they largely avail
themselves. A lending library is also attached to
the school. The highest attendance during last
session was five hundred and eighty-one, the lowest
two hundred and eighty-seven.</p>

<p>The influence of this school is very great, and
many pass on from it to the men&#8217;s Bible-class,
which is held on Sunday afternoons in the largest
basement room.<sup><a href="#fn.xi.6" name="fna.xi.6" id="fna.xi.6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>A servants&#8217; registry is attached to the deaconess
house, and through its means about four hundred
servants are annually provided with places.</p>

<p>Nearly fifty deaconesses make their home at this
central house, many of them having work in the
different parts of the city, perhaps at remote distances,
but returning at night to the home-like surroundings
and purer air of the central house. The
large sitting-room, the common living-room of the
deaconesses, is a charming place. It is of great
size, but made cheerful and attractive by pictures,
flowers, and bright and tasteful decorations that are
restful to the eyes. Both Mr. and Mrs. Pennefather
made it a principle of action to have the home life
cheerful, pleasant, and attractive, so that when the<a
  id="png.180" name="png.180"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">180/</span>176</samp>
sisters come in toward evening, tired physically, and
mentally depressed and exhausted by the long strain
of hearing tales of misery, and seeing sights of
wretchedness and squalor the day through, they
could be cheered not only by the words of sympathy
and love of their associates, but by the silent,
restful influences of their surroundings.</p>

<p>As I looked around the great room with deep-set
windows, brightened by flowers, and still more by
the happy faces of the deaconesses, some of whom
were young girls with the charms of happy girlhood
set off by the plain, black dress and wide white collar
of the deaconess garb, I could but think the
founders wise in arranging such pleasant, home-like
surroundings for their workers.</p>

<p>From the windows you look down into a beautiful
garden, a rare luxury for a London dwelling.
This garden was among the later accessions of Mr.
Pennefather, being purchased by him shortly before
his death. A train of circumstances led to its possession
which he regarded as markedly providential;
and the delightful uses to which &ldquo;that blessed garden,&rdquo;
as it has been called, has since been put,
seem to justify the importance he attached to securing
it. During the conference times great tents
are reared here for the refreshments which the
weary body needs. A fine old mulberry tree<a
  id="png.181" name="png.181"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">181/</span>177</samp>
extends its branches, and under its ample shade
meetings of one kind or another are held at all
hours of the day. The lawn, with its quiet, shady
walks, furnished with comfortable garden seats, provides
a meeting place for friends, where, in the intervals
between the services, those who perhaps
never see each other during any of the other fifty-one
weeks of the year may walk or sit together.
&ldquo;Here in more ordinary times may be seen the
children of the Orphanage (where thirty-six girls
form a happy, busy family) playing together, or
the deaconesses in their becoming little white caps,
who have run out for a breath of air. Here, too,
during the summer, a succession of tea-parties is
held for the different classes which have been
reached by the deaconesses in the more densely
populated parts of London, to whom the garden is
a very paradise.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xi.7" name="fna.xi.7" id="fna.xi.7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Before leaving the Central Deaconess Home I
must speak of one branch of work&mdash;the artistic
illustration of Scripture texts&mdash;because it so illustrates
the happy freedom and wisdom of the
Mildmay methods, which seek to develop the strength
of each sister in the line of her special aptitudes.
Two of the deaconesses have marked ability as
artists, and they devote their time to illuminating<a
  id="png.182" name="png.182"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">182/</span>178</samp>
texts and adorning Christmas and Easter cards with
rare and exquisite designs. From the sale of these
illuminations over five thousand dollars were realized
last year for the benefit of the institution.</p>

<p>The Conference Hall, too, should have a further
word of recommendation for the truly catholic spirit
in which it serves the interests of a myriad of good
causes. Besides the crowded meetings of the conference
there are held Sunday services throughout
the year. The hospitality of its rooms is readily
granted to every good cause with which the mission
has sympathy. During 1887 &ldquo;temperance society
meetings, railway men and their wives, Moravian
missions, Pastor Bost&#8217;s mission at La Force, the
MacAll Paris missions, the Sunday closing movement,
young men&#8217;s and young women&#8217;s Christian
associations, a Christian police association, the Children&#8217;s
Special Service mission, the Christmas Letter
mission, Bible readings for German residents, and
various other foreign and home missions have all in
turn been advocated here.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xi.8" name="fna.xi.8" id="fna.xi.8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>The larger number of the deaconesses at the
central house, as well as the twenty-five at the
branch house in South London, are employed in
twenty-one London parishes, where their work has
been sought by the clergymen; they go to all,<a
  id="png.183" name="png.183"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">183/</span>179</samp>
undertaking every kind of labor that can give them
access to the hearts and homes of the people.
While co-operating with the clergyman in charge of
a parish their work is superintended from the Deaconess
Home. They visit from house to house
among the sick and poor, hold mothers&#8217; meetings,
teach night-schools, hold Bible-classes separately
for men, women, and children; hold special classes
for working women and girls who are kept busily
employed during the day, and during the winter
months have a weekly average of more than nine
thousand attendants on their services. They are
solving the problem of &ldquo;how to save the masses&rdquo;
by resolving the masses into individuals, and then
influencing these individuals by the power of personal
effort and love.</p>

<p>But a few steps from Conference Hall is the Nursing
Home, where about one hundred &ldquo;nurse sisters,&rdquo;
nurses, and probationers make their home in the intervals
between their duties, and are presided over
by a lady superintendent of their own. Adjoining
is the Cottage Hospital, a beautiful building, the
gift of a lady in memory of her son. The walls
have been painted and decorated throughout by
some ladies who delight in using their skill to make
beautiful the homes of the sick.</p>

<p>A large hospital and medical mission also exist<a
  id="png.184" name="png.184"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">184/</span>180</samp>
in Bethnal Green, a densely populated part of London
that in some portions can vie with the worst
slums of the city. It was so necessary to provide
better accommodations for nursing the sufferers
than could be found in their poor homes that a
warehouse was fitted up with beds and transformed
into a small hospital. In 1887 four hundred and
thirteen patients were received at the hospital, and
in the dispensary for outside patients sixteen thousand
four hundred and eighteen visits were paid
during the year, nearly two thirds of which number
were to patients in their own houses. There is no
place in which a hospital could be more sorely
needed than in this destitute part of London, and
perhaps no place where it could be more appreciated.
&ldquo;I had no idea,&rdquo; said a man of the better
class who was brought in, &ldquo;of there being such a
place as this; you give as much attention to the
poorest man you get out of the street as could be
given to a prince.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xi.9" name="fna.xi.9" id="fna.xi.9">9</a></sup></p>

<p>Every Christmas some kind of an entertainment
is arranged for the hospital patients, and, through
the gift of friends, articles of warm clothing are
distributed to protect against the winter&#8217;s cold.</p>

<p>A variety of mission work is carried on in connection
with Bethnal Green. There is a Men&#8217;s<a
  id="png.185" name="png.185"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">185/</span>181</samp>
Institute, open every evening except Sunday and
Monday, in connection with which is a savings&#8217;
bank that is well patronized. There is a Lads&#8217; Institute,
where the deaconesses have classes and
meet the boys in a friendly way; a men&#8217;s lodging-house,
where a comfortable bed and shelter can be
had for eight cents a night. The latter is an enterprise
which could be imitated with profit in all our
large American cities, where it is very difficult for
the homeless and poverty-stricken to obtain a decent
lodging, or to find any place, in fact, where
liquor is not sold. There are also evangelistic services
in the mission here, Sunday-schools, Bible-classes,
temperance meetings, a soup kitchen, and a
coffee bar, where, during Christmas week, between
four and five hundred men and boys were given
light refreshments, and at the same time some idea
of the kindliness and good-will that are associated
with this happy season of the year.</p>

<p>There are also two convalescent homes, one at
Barnet and one at Brighton. The home at Brighton
is especially designed for the poor patients of the
East End mission. The report for the year ending
December 31, 1887, says that five hundred and fifty

<p>Mildmay nurse deaconesses have also charge of
the Doncaster General Infirmary, the Nurses&#8217; Institute
at Malta, and the Medical Mission Hospital at
Jaffa, where two hundred and nineteen patients
were received the last year, of whom one hundred
and seventy-five were Moslems.</p>

<p>There also exists under the supervision of Mildmay
workers a railway mission that was begun in
1880 for men on duty at two of the London stations.
An organized mission has sprung up from
this small beginning that has now extended over
three great lines of railroads which employ thousands
of men.</p>

<p>The long list of labors given do not exhaust the
efforts of Mildmay workers, for, besides special teas
for policemen and postmen, and the mission room
and day-school at Ball&#8217;s Pond, there is also an educational
branch that is meeting the demand for
higher educational advantages for women, under
distinctly religious influences, by the Clapton House
School.</p>

<p>The questions involuntarily present themselves,
when reading the undertakings just enumerated,
that involve not only faithfulness and devotion in
service, but disciplined, practiced faculties, &ldquo;What
class of women are these by whom so much has
been accomplished? And what is the training that<a
  id="png.187" name="png.187"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">187/</span>183</samp>
has made them so effective?&rdquo; It is difficult to answer
the first question. The deaconesses are of all
classes, many of them being ladies who devote their
time, talent, and means to forward the cause. There
are a good many daughters of clergymen, who are
carrying out the associations of their life at home.
Just how many are self-supporting and just how
many are maintained by the Institution are facts
that are never known; as Mrs. Pennefather says in a
letter of February 11, 1889, &ldquo;There are certain<a
  id="png.188" name="png.188"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">188/</span>184</samp>
points we deal with as strictly private. While every
probationer pays four guineas for her first month,
the after monetary arrangements are never known
except to myself and the resident lady superintendent.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<p><span class="smc">Note.</span>&mdash;There is a further department at Mildmay that has
never been named, but is certainly an important and busy one;
it might be called the &ldquo;Department of Inquiry,&rdquo; for certainly
the personal visits and letters received, inquiring into the details
of the institution, must be very large. My obligations to Mrs.
Pennefather are great, who, both by letter and printed matter,
has placed a great number of facts at my disposal, of which I
have availed myself freely in writing this sketch. Mrs. Pennefather&#8217;s
words, &ldquo;we are glad when we can help any Christian
work with the experience God has permitted us to gather,&rdquo;
echo the words of the great apostle, <a name="gal66" id="gal66">&ldquo;Let him that is taught
in the word communicate to him that teacheth in all good
things.&rdquo;</a> I remember, too, the gracious patience with which,
during one of the crowded days of the last conference, Miss
Coventry, the superintendent, spent a long hour with us, answering
fully and minutely the many questions which we put
when trying to supplement our want of knowledge by her long
experience. Indeed, the spirit of Mildmay impressed me as
generous and helpful; as has been said, &ldquo;Over the whole
house rules the spirit of love, devotion, and prayer.&rdquo;<sup>*</sup>
</p>

<hr class="footnote" />
<p style="font-size: x-small;">*
&ldquo;Deaconess Work in England,&rdquo; <i>The Churchman</i>, May 12, 1888.</p>
</div>

<p>The second question is more easy of response.
There is a probation house, where ladies that present
themselves as candidates are received for a
month, and are given work in teaching orphan
children, or go out to the city missions and the
night-schools under the care of a deaconess. If the
probation has proved satisfactory the candidate enters
the training-school called &ldquo;the Willows,&rdquo; a mile
or two from the Central House, a pleasant home
which about three years ago came into the possession
of the institution and the inmates of the
school, formerly accommodated in five small houses,
are now gathered, at slightly greater expense,
under one roof in the larger, pleasanter home. The
following extracts, taken from a little circular called
&ldquo;A Missionary Training-school,&rdquo; will give us a good
idea of the life of the embryo deaconesses, and the
instruction, practical and theoretical, that they receive.
&ldquo;The house, which lies a little back from
the road, is entered through a conservatory passage,
and on the other side of the spacious hall, with its
illuminated motto, &lsquo;Peace be to this house,&rsquo; above<a
  id="png.189" name="png.189"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">189/</span>185</samp>
the fireplace, are the lady superintendent&#8217;s sitting-room
and the large dining-room, where, on the day
when I visited &lsquo;the Willows,&rsquo; about thirty of us sat
down to dinner. Several others were absent in connection
with their medical studies. Both these
rooms open on a terrace, and beyond stretches a
garden which, even in lifeless winter-time, looked
inviting, and, in its spring beauty and summer loveliness,
must be in itself a training for the young
natures which are learning in the slums of Bethnal
Green and Hoxton their hard acquaintance with
sin and sorrow. Perhaps in these days of strain and
toil too little has been thought of the need of young
hearts for some gentle relief from the first shock of
meeting with the evil with which older workers
have a mournful familiarity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The inmates of the Training-school are not deaconesses
alone. The school was started to prepare
workers for the foreign field, but the crying need of
the vast metropolis turned attention to the home
field. The Church of England Zenana Society sends
its candidates to Mrs. Pennefather for training,
and she is glad to accept them, believing that a variety
of companionship is needed by those who, in
zeal for their personal work, might lose the broad
sympathy for all kinds of Christian labor, which is an
invaluable cultivation for wise and useful laborers.</p>
<a id="png.190" name="png.190"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">190/</span>186</samp>

<p>The several classes who pass through the course
of training may be designated as follows:</p>

<p><i>a</i>.) Those who pass on to the deaconess house.</p>

<p><i>b</i>.) Candidates for (1)&nbsp;the Church of England
Zenana Society; (2)&nbsp;the Church Missionary Society.</p>

<p><i>c</i>.) Those who receive medical training for working
among the women and children of India.</p>

<p><i>d</i>.) Those who are as yet unconnected with any
society.</p>

<p><i>e</i>.) When vacancies occur some few are received
who merely return to home or parish work, but who
are greatly benefitted by training and experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The general routine of life seems to be as follows:
Prayers at eight o&#8217;clock, then breakfast, followed
by a certain amount of domestic duty which
falls to the lot of each. For it is not forgotten that
these years of training are not for the sake of home
life, but as preparation for the self-denials of missionary
life. Speaking broadly, the mornings seem
to be chiefly devoted to classes; afternoons to out
of door and district work; and thus theory and practice
pleasantly relieve and support each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are regular Bible-classes held by different
clergymen, and once a fortnight there are lectures
on the history of missionary work. There are
classes in Hindustani, drawing, and singing, and<a
  id="png.191" name="png.191"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">191/</span>187</samp>
for those whose education is defective, elementary
classes in arithmetic, geometry, and short-hand.
The probationers are also given training in the
duties of the store-room, and the order and method
that they are taught in caring for the minutest
details must certainly form valuable habits in all
those who have any desire to profit by the instruction
they receive.</p>

<p>For those who are destined for medical work
among the women of India there is a special course
of medical training, both theoretical and practical.</p>

<p>The age requirement is not so strictly maintained
at Mildmay as at many other deaconess houses,
but, as a rule, ladies from about twenty to thirty
years of age are preferred as students in the training-school.
The sum of three hundred dollars is
charged for the year&#8217;s expenses at the training-school,
medical students paying one hundred dollars
additional.</p>

<p>Our study of the Mildmay Institutions has been
somewhat extensive. As was said at the beginning
of the chapter, the great freedom and simplicity of
the Mildmay methods, as well as the happy faculty
that its directors possess of utilizing all varieties of
individual talent, make this deaconess establishment
one that is full of valuable suggestions to the similar
institutions that are now arising in American<a
  id="png.192" name="png.192"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">192/</span>188</samp>
Methodism. No working force is wasted; if a deaconess
possess a special talent, she is given a field in
which to exercise it; and if exceptional conditions
arise workers are found ready to meet them. This
training provides well-equipped missionaries for the
foreign field, and equally well-prepared missionaries
for the great field of the present hour&mdash;the home
mission work in the crowded wards of great cities.</p>

<p>The annual expenses of the Mildmay Institutions
vary from one hundred and ten thousand to one
hundred and twenty thousand dollars. Sixty thousand
dollars are received in voluntary contributions,
and the remaining sum is generally obtained
from friends who are immediately concerned in the
work.</p>

<p>It is certainly a marvelous tribute to Christian
faith, although it is never heralded as such, that an
establishment of the extent and magnitude of Mildmay
has been maintained for years with no permanent
endowment to fall back upon, and that annually
the renewed self-denial of constant friends has to
supply the large amount of money needed to meet
the entire expenses. Besides those outward and
visible services which it renders &ldquo;for the love of
Christ, and in his name&rdquo; Mildmay furnishes a constant
testimony to the fidelity of the Christian faith
in the hearts of many believers.</p>

<h3 class="newchap">CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<h4>DEACONESSES IN SCOTLAND.</h4>


<p><span class="smc">When</span> Fliedner went on his second tour to England
he extended his journey to Scotland, and
ventured to Edinburgh at a time when the cholera
was sweeping with fearful ravages through the city
in order to become acquainted with Dr. Chalmers.
The great Scotch divine and his good deeds, that
were connected with all kinds of charitable endeavor,
moved the German pastor to admiration
and stirred him to holy emulation. On the other
hand, that Chalmers was profoundly touched by the
work that Fliedner had accomplished in Germany
there can be no doubt; we have his own words to
testify to the importance he attached to the diaconate
of women. In his lectures on Romans, he
says: &ldquo;Here, too, we are presented with a most
useful indication, the employment of female agency,
under the eye and with the sanction of an apostle,
in the business of the Church. It is well to have
inspired authority for a practice too little known,
and too little preached on in modern times. Phebe<a
  id="png.194" name="png.194"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">194/</span>190</samp>
belonged to the order of deaconesses, in which capacity
she had been the helper of many, including
Paul himself. In what respect she served them is
not particularly specified. Like the women in the
gospels who waited on our Saviour, she may have
ministered to them of her substance, though there
can be little doubt that, as the holder of an official
station in the Church, she ministered to them by
her services also.&rdquo; It is but recently, however, that
deaconesses have become incorporated into the religious
life of Scotland, and, so far, they do not exist
in connection with the Free Church, of which Chalmers
was the able and heroic leader, but only in
connection with the national Church&mdash;the old historic
Church of Scotland. Within this Church the
question has assumed the form, not alone of the revival
of the apostolic order of deaconesses, but also
of the organization of all the manifold activities of
women within the Church into one whole, which
is put under the authority and direction of the officers
of the Church.</p>

<p>Isolated attempts in this direction had previously
been made, but in 1885 the first definite steps were
taken when the Committee on Christian Life and
Work, of which Dr. Charteris was the Convener, presented
to the General Assembly a report on &ldquo;The
need of an organization of women&#8217;s work in the<a
  id="png.195" name="png.195"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">195/</span>191</samp>
Church,&rdquo; part of which is as follows: &ldquo;The organization
of women&#8217;s work in the Church has become
a subject of pressing interest. The Assembly has
already sanctioned and regulated the organization
of women&#8217;s work in collecting for foreign missions,
and in sending out and superintending missionaries.
The great and growing strength of the movement
thus recognized is one of the most gratifying things
in our mission; ... but of still older date, and
not less powerful, is the part taken by women in
the home work of the parish church. Lady visitors
are carrying messages of divine truth and of human
sympathy into the dwellings of the poor both
in town and country. Many have been trained as
nurses that they may be skilled ministrants to the
suffering and sick; and there can be little doubt
that the greater part of the actual personal help
which ministers receive in parishes is from the
women of the congregations. But those who have
done most of the good work are most instant in
asking from the Church some means of doing still
more. From ministers and from their female helpers
have come many requests to the committee for
some provision for training; some recognition and
organization of those who are trained&hellip;. In the
Church of England are many homes for nurses and
deaconesses; training institutions for female<a
  id="png.196" name="png.196"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">196/</span>192</samp>
mission work of every kind; and the rapidity with
which they are multiplying proves of itself how
much they are needed; also non-conformist institutions
of the kind, and some separate from all
Churches. Your committee believe that the time
has fully come for our Church&#8217;s taking steps to supply
her own wants in this important department of
mission work.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xii.1" name="fna.xii.1" id="fna.xii.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The General Assembly then directed the committee
to inquire into the subject of women&#8217;s work in
the Church, and to bring up a definite report to the
next assembly. The committee accepted the task,
sent out requests to every parish for suggestions as
to the forms of Christian work to be carried on by
women, and the best means of making preparation
for their special training, and prepared themselves
by personal inspection of the leading institutions
for training women workers in England to be able to
answer intelligently the same questions. A scheme
was reported in 1886 which should incorporate all
existing parish organizations, such as Sabbath-school
teachers&#8217; and women&#8217;s societies of all kinds,
and should aim at increasing their number and
working power. In 1887 regulations were perfected
for working this scheme, and the approval of<a
  id="png.197" name="png.197"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">197/</span>193</samp>
this by the Assembly of 1887 made the new plan a
part of the organized work of the Church.</p>

<p>The comprehensive character of the new departure
in the Church of Scotland is plainly seen from
a view of the organization as it now exists. The
three grades into which the Christian women workers
are divided embrace every kind of work done
in connection with the Church. The first grade is
general in its character, and forms an association
called the Women&#8217;s Guild. In each parish the
members of Bible-classes, of Young Women&#8217;s Congregational
Associations, of mission working parties,
of Dorcas societies, as well as tract distributers,
Sabbath-school teachers, members of the Church
choir, and any who are engaged in the service of
Christ in the Church are all to be accepted as
members of the guild. The next higher grade is
the Women Workers&#8217; Guild, for which a certain age
is required, and an experience of at least three
years, with the approval of the kirk session which
enrolls them. In connection with this guild are
associates, who have a similar relation to the members
of the Women Workers&#8217; Guild that the associates
have to deaconesses in the English deaconess
houses. They are not pledged to regular or constant
service, but engage to do some work or contribute
some money every year. They can go to<a
  id="png.198" name="png.198"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">198/</span>194</samp>
the deaconess house, put on the garb of the deaconess
while there, and as long as they remain can
assume the responsibilities and enjoy the privileges
belonging to deaconesses. The third higher grade
is that of the deaconesses. Any one desiring to
become a deaconess &ldquo;must purpose to devote herself,
so long as she shall occupy the position of a
deaconess, especially to Christian work in connection
with the Church, as the chief object of her
life.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xii.2" name="fna.xii.2" id="fna.xii.2">2</a></sup>
Provision was also made for a training-school
and home where deaconesses could be prepared
for their duties.</p>

<p>There are a great many ladies who for a long
time have been engaged in doing the practical work
of a deaconess without being clothed in the garb,
or invested with the office. The Church of Scotland
recognized these workers by providing two
classes of deaconesses, who should be equal in position,
but have different spheres of activity. Those
who for seven years had been known as active
workers, and who have given their lives largely to
Christian service, are accepted as deaconesses of
the first class, and are free to work wherever they
find themselves most useful within the limits of
the Church. The second class embraces those who
shall have received training in the deaconess<a
  id="png.199" name="png.199"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">199/</span>195</samp>
institution, or have been in connection with it for at
least two years.</p>

<p>When the measure was finally passed by the
General Assembly there was no delay in carrying
into execution the details indicated by the plan of
work. The Deaconess Institution and Training
Home was at once started. It was located at Edinburgh,
as the most central and convenient place
for the institution, and as furnishing the most available
advantages for the instruction and training of
the deaconesses. From here as a center the work
is expected to penetrate into every part of Scotland
by means of the trained workers whose services will
be available for all parts of the country when desired
by the ministers and kirk sessions. With true
Scotch prudence and wisdom it was arranged that
the lady who was chosen to be the superintendent
should fit herself thoroughly for the duties of
her responsible place by becoming familiar with
the workings of similar institutions in England.
She was accordingly given six months&#8217; leave of absence,
which she spent among the great London
Homes, and only assumed the duties of her position
May 1, 1888. Meanwhile the Home had opened
under the temporary care of a lady who had been
a worker in Mrs. Meredith&#8217;s Prison Mission, and for
six years a Mildmay deaconess. It had from the<a
  id="png.200" name="png.200"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">200/</span>196</samp>
beginning the warm co-operation of sympathizing,
influential friends. Regular courses of lectures were
arranged on subjects connected with Christian work,
and as similar courses will be demanded of like institutions
in America it may be interesting to give
the syllabus in full:</p>

<p>Another wise provision in this Scotch home is
the arrangement by which those who do not wish to
become deaconesses, but who want to become competent
Christian workers in their own homes, can<a
  id="png.202" name="png.202"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">202/</span>198</samp>
come here and spend some months in receiving
training and instruction in various methods of Christian
work. There is no department in life in which
many blunders and much loss of time and usefulness
cannot be prevented by making use of the experience
of others who have previously overcome the
difficulties to be encountered. In other words, we
need to obtain all the preparation and discipline we
can possibly have in order to do our work well; and
especially is this true of Christian work, which demands
the highest service that the heart and soul
of humanity can give. Many individuals will come
to the home to be trained and fitted to work in
their own homes, and will start new lines of
Christian activity that will win the sympathies and
efforts of many who are eager to be employed
in good works, if only they can have competent
direction.</p>

<p>A pamphlet entitled <i>The Deaconess Institution
and Training Home</i> says: &ldquo;Are there not many
parts all over Scotland&mdash;mines, quarries, etc.&mdash;where
the population is poor and hard-working?
Would it not in such places be an advantage both
to minister and people to have a Christian lady,
trained, experienced, and devoted, to live and work
among them? Or, which would be possible in
every parish, would it not be a great advantage that<a
  id="png.203" name="png.203"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">203/</span>199</samp>
in case of need&mdash;in a mining accident, an outbreak
of sickness&mdash;a trained Christian nurse should be
available during the emergency?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The General Assembly provided that deaconesses
should be solemnly inducted into their office at a
religious service in church. It also provided &ldquo;that
along with the application for the admission of any
person to the office of a deaconess there shall be
submitted a certificate from a committee of the
General Assembly intrusted with that duty stating
that the candidate is qualified in respect of education,
and that she has had seven years&#8217; experience
in Christian work, or two years&#8217; training in the
Deaconess Institution and Training Home.&rdquo; Also,
&ldquo;Before granting the application, the kirk session
shall intimate to the presbytery their intention of
doing so, unless objection be offered by the presbytery
at its first meeting thereafter.&rdquo; On Sunday,
December 9, 1888, the first deaconess was set apart
to her duties. The kirk session was already in possession
of the necessary certificates testifying to her
&ldquo;character, education, experience, devotedness, and
power to serve and co-operate with others.&rdquo; Due
intimation had been made to the presbytery. The
questions were put that were appointed by the General
Assembly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you desire to be set apart as a deaconess,<a
  id="png.204" name="png.204"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">204/</span>200</samp>
and as such to serve the Lord Jesus Christ in the
Church, which is his body?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you promise, as a deaconess of the Church
of Scotland, to work in connection with that Church,
subject to its courts, and in particular to the kirk
session of the parish in which you work?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you humbly engage, in the strength and
grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, our Lord and Master,
faithfully and prayerfully to discharge the duties
of this office?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lady who, by answering the above questions,
received the sanction of the Church as one of its
appointed officers was Lady Grisell Baillie, of Dryburgh
Abbey. She writes to the author of this
book: &ldquo;I count it a great honor to be permitted to
serve in the Church of my fathers, and I pray that
I may be enabled faithfully and prayerfully to fulfill
the duties to which I am called, and that it maybe
for the glory of our God and Saviour that I am
permitted to work in his vineyard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Davidson, who was temporary superintendent
of the home, but who is now engaged in organizing
branches of the Women&#8217;s Guild throughout
Scotland, and Miss Alice Maud Maxwell, the present
superintendent of the home, have also been set
apart to the same office. As has been said, &ldquo;Each
represents an old Scottish family, whose members<a
  id="png.205" name="png.205"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">205/</span>201</samp>
have been distinguished for Christian and philanthropic
labors;&rdquo; and &ldquo;each represents a different
type of deaconess work.&rdquo; Lady Grisell Baillie is
engaged in gentle ministrations among the people
of her own home. Miss Davidson is at the service
of every minister who desires aid in organizing
women&#8217;s work in his parish. And Miss Maxwell
is at the training-home, leading a busy life
in directing the class labors and missionary activities
that center around it and in impressing her life
and spirit upon a band of workers who are to
further Christ&#8217;s cause both at home and in the
mission field.</p>

<p>The mention of any facts that can bring before
us the varied character that the deaconess work can
assume is valuable. For to be truly useful, this
cause needs to provide a place for women of very
unlike qualities, and also to allow a certain degree
of freedom which will insure the individuality of
each worker.</p>

<p>The action of the Church of Scotland has had its
influence upon the Reformed Churches throughout
the world holding the presbyterial system. At the
session of the London Council of the Alliance of Reformed
and Presbyterian Churches during the summer
of 1888, Dr. Charteris presented a report embracing
many of the features of the elaborate scheme<a
  id="png.206" name="png.206"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">206/</span>202</samp>
which he had previously devised for the Church of
Scotland. And the Council, in receiving the report,
not only approved it, but &ldquo;commended the details of
the scheme stated in the report to the consideration
of the churches represented in the Alliance.&rdquo; We
may regard the Presbyterian churches of Great
Britain, therefore, as committed, not only to the
indorsement of deaconesses as officers in the service
of the Church, but to the organization of the
whole work of women in the churches, under ecclesiastical
authority and direction.</p>

<p>There is one feature of the deaconess cause as it
has been developed in the Church of Scotland that
is of especial interest to the Methodists of America.
Most of the great deaconess houses of England
have sprung from the personal faith and works of
earnest-souled individuals. Mildmay, for example,
is a living testimony to the faithfulness and energy
of the Rev. Mr. Pennefather and those associated
with him. Within the Church of England the recognition
accorded deaconesses is a partial one, resting
on the principles and rules signed by the archbishops
and eighteen bishops, and suggested for
adoption in 1871. But as yet the English Church
has not formally accepted this utterance, and made
it authoritative. The German deaconess houses,
while receiving the practical indorsement of the<a
  id="png.207" name="png.207"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">207/</span>203</samp>
State Church of Germany, are not in any way officially
connected with it. Even Kaiserswerth itself
is solely responsible to those who contribute to its
support for a right use of the means placed at its
command. The same fact applies to the Paris deaconess
houses. They are all detached efforts, not
parts of a general system. But the Scotch deaconesses
are responsible to a church, and a church is
responsible for their work. The Church of Scotland
is, therefore, justified in its claim when it says that
the adoption of the scheme of the organization of
women&#8217;s work by the assembly of 1888, &ldquo;is the
first attempt since the Reformation to make the
organization of women&#8217;s work a branch of the <ins class="transcriber"
  title="Transcriber's note: Original has 'geneneral'">general</ins>
organization of the Church, under the control
of her several judicatories.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xii.3" name="fna.xii.3" id="fna.xii.3">3</a></sup>
The second attempt
was made, which was the first also for any Church
in America, when, May 18, 1888, the Methodist
Episcopal Church of the United States instituted
the office of deaconess, and made it an inherent
part of the Church economy, under the direction
and control of the Annual Conferences.</p>

<h3 class="newchap">CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<h4>THE DEACONESS CAUSE IN AMERICA.</h4>


<p><span class="smc">It</span> was no part of the plan of this book, when
first projected, to treat of the deaconess cause as
it is developing within the United States of America,
but gradually, through the kindness of many
friends belonging to different denominations, a number
of facts have been obtained which bear directly
upon the question of how the example of European
deaconess houses has influenced and is influencing
the Protestant Churches of America; and it seems
unwise to omit them from the consideration of the
subject.</p>

<p>Naturally the German Lutherans, who were well
acquainted with the deaconess work in their native
land, were the first to try to introduce it among
their churches. In the yearly report sent out
from Kaiserswerth, January 1, 1847, Fliedner mentions
that an urgent appeal had been made to him
to send deaconesses to an important city in the
United States, there to have the oversight of a hospital,
and to found a mother-house for the training<a
  id="png.209" name="png.209"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">209/</span>205</samp>
of deaconesses. In the report for the following
year Fliedner again refers to the call from America,
and states his intention to extend his travels to the
New World, and to take with him sisters who shall
aid in founding a mother-house. In the summer
of 1849 he was enabled to carry out his intention,
and July 14, 1849, accompanied by four deaconesses,
he reached Pittsburg, Pa., where Rev.
Dr. W. A. Passavant, who had written so many
urgent appeals for his aid, was awaiting him. The
building had already been secured for a hospital
and deaconess home, and, July 17, was solemnly
dedicated at a service where Fliedner delivered the
principal address, and a large audience testified to
their interest.</p>

<p>Before his return to Europe Fliedner visited the
New York Synod, and, in an English discourse,
described the character and aims of Kaiserswerth,
and commended the newly founded institution at
Pittsburg to the sympathy and aid of the German
Lutheran Church in America. No further results
were reached, as the synod contented itself with
resolving that &ldquo;this Ministerium awaits with deep
interest the result of the work made in behalf of the
institution of Protestant deaconesses at
Pittsburg.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xiii.1" name="fna.xiii.1" id="fna.xiii.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The institution is occasionally heard of afterward<a
  id="png.210" name="png.210"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">210/</span>206</samp>
in the proceedings of the Pittsburg Synod,
and in the paper, <i>The Missionary</i>, published under
the auspices of the same Church. Urgent appeals
were also sent out for devoted Christian women to
come to the aid of the sisters and to join their numbers;
but although the hospital, commended by their
skillful and able ministrations as nurses, had the full
approval of the public, there were few, if any, who
came to join them, and they were unduly burdened
by a task too great for their small number.</p>

<p>In 1854 Dr. Passavant resigned his pastoral
charge, and devoted his entire time to the furtherance
of the cause, but, up to the present, it has not
attained the complete organization and wide extension
that its friends in the German Lutheran Church
have desired.</p>

<p>The institutions which owe their existence to Dr.
Passavant&#8217;s efforts are the infirmary at Pittsburg;
the hospital and deaconess home in Milwaukee;
the hospital in Jacksonville, Ill.; the orphanages
for girls in Rochester and Mount Vernon, N. Y.,
and one for boys in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>There is, at the present time, only one of the
original Kaiserswerth sisters left, and that is Sister
Elizabeth, the head deaconess at Rochester. Dr.
Passavant still continues to labor at forming a complete
organization on the basis of the Kaiserswerth<a
  id="png.211" name="png.211"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">211/</span>207</samp>
system, and, to quote the words of Dr. A. Spaeth,
&ldquo;As he succeeded forty years ago in bringing
the first sisters over from Kaiserswerth to Pittsburg,
I have no doubt that now, when the Church
is at last awakening to the importance of this
work, he will succeed in the completion of his
undertaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A more recent development of the deaconess
work in the German Lutheran Church has arisen
in connection with the German hospital in Philadelphia.
The hospital was well equipped for its
work, but there was much dissatisfaction with the
nursing, which was inefficient and unskillful. In
the fall of 1882 the hospital authorities turned for
advice and co-operation to Dr. W. J. Mann, Dr. A.
Spaeth, and other clergymen of the denomination
in Philadelphia. It was determined to secure German
deaconesses as nurses. Several attempts were
made to induce Kaiserswerth, or some other large
mother-house in Germany, to give up a few sisters to
the hospital, but on all sides the applications were
refused. The deaconesses were too greatly needed
in the Old World to be spared for work in the
New. At length, through the unremitting efforts of
Consul Meyer, and of John D. Lankenau, president
of the board of managers, a small independent community
of sisters under the direction of Marie Krueger,<a
  id="png.212" name="png.212"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">212/</span>208</samp>
who had herself been trained in Kaiserswerth,
acceded to the proposal, and the head-deaconess,
with six sisters, arrived in Philadelphia June 19,
1884. They left the field of their self-denying work
in the hospital and poor-house at Iserlohn, in Westphalia,
sadly to the regret of the authorities and
citizens of the place, but to the hospital at Philadelphia
they gave invaluable aid. From the first
their good services met with appreciation. The
efficiency of the hospital service was greatly increased;
and from physicians and hospital authorities
there was only one testimony, and that a most
favorable one, to the value of deaconesses as trained
nurses. Mr. Lankenau, who has ever been the wise
and munificent patron of the institution, determined
to insure a succession of these admirable nurses for
the service of the hospital, and, at an expense of
over five hundred thousand dollars, he built an edifice
of palace-like proportions, and made over this
munificent gift to the hospital corporation. It was
accepted by them January 10, 1887. The western
wing of the building is used as a home for aged
men and women; the eastern wing is a residence
and training-school for the deaconesses, the chapel
uniting the two, and the whole being known as the
Mary J. Drexel Home and Philadelphia Mother-house
of Deaconesses.</p>
<a id="png.213" name="png.213"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">213/</span>209</samp>

<p>A visit to the Home convinced me that the regulations
of the house, the work of the sisters, and
the devotion to duty that characterize the mother-houses
in Germany rule also in this home in the New
World. The imposing entrance hall with the great
stair-way, the floor and stairs of white marble, the
wide halls and spacious reception-rooms and offices
seemed at first almost incongruous surroundings for
the modest active deaconesses, some of whom were
busy in the hospital wards, others hanging clothes
on the line, and others occupied in duties within
the building. But place and environments are only
incidental matters; the spirit within is the determining
quality; and a conversation with the <i>Oberin</i>
(head deaconess) and the rector left me with the
persuasion that the spirit of earnest devotion to
God and humanity is the main-spring of duty in
this house.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the rooms for the sisters is
similar to that at Kaiserswerth; each consecrated
sister has a small apartment simply furnished for
her own use. The older probationers are divided
two and three in a room. Those who have recently
entered are placed in two large rooms, but here
every one has her own four walls&mdash;even if they are
only made by linen curtains. When Elizabeth
Fry first visited Kaiserswerth, among the arrangements<a
  id="png.214" name="png.214"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">214/</span>210</samp>
that she at once recognized and commended
was that by which each deaconess was
given the privacy of her own apartment. In the
deaconess houses that are so rapidly springing
up in different parts of the United States this
provision ought to be guarded with care, for a life
that is so constantly drawn out in ministrations to
others should have some moments of absolute privacy
upon which no one can intrude.</p>

<p>There are at present thirty-two deaconesses at
the Philadelphia Mother-house, twenty of whom
are probationers. The house was admitted to the
Kaiserswerth Association, and will henceforth be
represented at the Conferences. The direction is
vested in a rector and head deaconess, neither of
whom can be removed except on just cause of
complaint. The distinctive dress is black, with
blue or white aprons, white caps and collars.
There is one addition to their garb which Fliedner
would have looked upon with disfavor, and that
is a cross&mdash;worn by the sisters from the time they
are fully accepted as deaconesses.</p>

<p>The first consecration took place in the beautiful
chapel of the Home, January 13, 1889, when three
deaconesses were accepted as members of the order.</p>

<p>For those who desire to form a good conception
of the deaconess institutions as they are conducted<a
  id="png.215" name="png.215"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">215/</span>211</samp>
in Germany, a visit to the Philadelphia Mother-house
of Deaconesses will be fruitful of valuable
suggestions.<sup><a href="#fn.xiii.2" name="fna.xiii.2" id="fna.xiii.2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>In July, 1887, a Swedish Lutheran pastor in
Omaha sent a probationer to Philadelphia to be
trained as a sister for a deaconess house to be established
in that central city of the United States.
In 1888 four others joined her, and the building of
a hospital and deaconess home is now progressing
by the generous support of all classes of philanthropists
in Omaha. A deaconess home has also
recently been founded by Norwegian Lutherans in
South Brooklyn, L.&nbsp;I.</p>

<p>In the German Reformed Church a layman
endeavored in 1866 to arouse interest in the deaconess
office. The Hon. J. Dixon Roman, of Hagerstown,
Md., at Christmas gave five thousand
dollars to the congregation, and with it sent a
proposition to the consistory that three ladies of
the congregation should be chosen and ordained to
the order of deaconesses, with absolute control of
the income of said fund for the purposes and duties
as practiced in the early days of the
Church.<sup><a href="#fn.xiii.3" name="fna.xiii.3" id="fna.xiii.3">3</a></sup><a
  id="png.216" name="png.216"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">216/</span>212</samp>
This, and the action of the Lebanon Classis in
1867, requesting the synod &ldquo;to take into consideration
the propriety of restoring the apostolic
society of deaconesses,&rdquo; seem to have been
the only steps taken by those connected with this
denomination.</p>

<p>In the Protestant Episcopal Church of America
the bishop of Maryland first instituted an order
of deaconesses in connection with St. Andrew&#8217;s
Parish, Baltimore, Md. Two ladies gave themselves
to ministering to the poor, and, with the
sanction and approval of the bishop, a house was
obtained and given the name of St. Andrew&#8217;s Infirmary.
In 1873 there were four resident deaconesses
and four associates.<sup><a href="#fn.xiii.4" name="fna.xiii.4" id="fna.xiii.4">4</a></sup>
An early report of the
infirmary says: &ldquo;The deaconesses look to no organization
of persons to furnish the pecuniary aid
required by the demands of their position. Their
first efforts have been for the destitute and sick.
At the home they minister daily to the suffering
and destitute sick wherever found; some requiring
only temporary medical aid and nursing; others,
whom God has chastened with more continuous
suffering, requiring, in their penury, constant care
and continual ministration.&rdquo; There is also under<a
  id="png.217" name="png.217"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">217/</span>213</samp>
their charge a church school for vagrant children,
and one also for the children of those comfortably
situated in life.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Forms for Setting Apart Deaconesses,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Rules for Self-Examination,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Rules of
Discipline&rdquo; in the order of deaconesses in Maryland
are largely patterned after the Kaiserswerth
rules. In truth, the general questions for self-examination
in regard to external duties, spiritual
duties to the sick, the conduct of the deaconesses
or sisters to those whom they meet, and the
means for improving in the duties of the office are
in many cases selected, and but slightly altered,
from the series prepared by Pastor
Fliedner.<sup><a href="#fn.xiii.5" name="fna.xiii.5" id="fna.xiii.5">5</a></sup>
The influence of the devout German pastor is indelibly
stamped upon the deaconess cause in whatever denomination
it has developed during the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>In 1864 the deaconesses of the Diocese of Alabama
were organized by Bishop Wilmer. Under
the supervision of the bishop the three deaconesses
with whom the order originated were associated in
taking charge of an orphanage and boarding-school
for girls. In 1873 there were five deaconesses, one
probationer, and two resident
associates.<sup><a href="#fn.xiii.6" name="fna.xiii.6" id="fna.xiii.6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>In the Church Home all of the work is done by<a
  id="png.218" name="png.218"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">218/</span>214</samp>
the inmates. As in the foreign Homes, the deaconesses
are provided with food and raiment, and during
sickness or old age they are cared for at the
expense of the order. They are forbidden to receive
fee or compensation for their services. Any
remuneration that is made is paid to the order. In
one feature, however, the deaconesses of Alabama
differ from either their German or English sisters,
and that is in the care of their individual means.
The &ldquo;Constitution and Rules&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The private
funds of deaconesses shall not be expended without
the approval of the chief deaconess or the
bishop.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xiii.7" name="fna.xiii.7" id="fna.xiii.7">7</a></sup>
This usage prevails in sisterhoods, but, outside of
this instance, so far as the author has been able to
learn is not known in deaconess institutions.</p>

<p>The rules for the associates in connection with
the order are given somewhat at length, from which
the following are taken. After defining an associate
as a Christian woman desiring to aid the work
of the deaconesses, and admonishing her that, although
not bound by the rules of the Community,
yet she must be careful to lead such a life as is
becoming one associated in a work of religion
and charity, she is requested &ldquo;to state what kind
of work she will undertake, under the direction of<a
  id="png.219" name="png.219"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">219/</span>215</samp>
the chief deaconess, and to report the result to
her at such intervals as may be agreed upon.&rdquo; The
following modes of assistance are suggested as most
useful; namely, &ldquo;to provide and make clothing for
the poor; to collect alms; to procure work, or promote
its sale; to teach in the school; to assist in
music or other classes; to relieve the destitute; to
minister to the sick; to visit and instruct the ignorant;
to attend the funeral arrangements for the
poor; and to take charge of or assist in the decoration
of the church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The feature of the union of the associates with
the deaconesses is one whose importance can
scarcely be exaggerated. There are many who
would be able to serve for a short time in this relation
whose valuable aid would be entirely lost if
none but deaconesses who give all their time and
strength could work in the order.</p>

<p>In the Diocese of Long Island Bishop Littlejohn
instituted an association of deaconesses by publicly
admitting six women to the office of deaconess
in St. Mary&#8217;s Church, Brooklyn, February 11, 1872.
The association has not continued in the form in
which it originated, but has now changed into the
Sisterhood of St. John the Evangelist. Still this
sisterhood retains many of the distinctive deaconess
features. A sister may, for instance, withdraw<a
  id="png.220" name="png.220"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">220/</span>216</samp>
from the sisterhood for proper cause. She labors
without remuneration, and the sisters live together
in a home, or singly, as they may please, in any
place where their work is located.</p>

<p>In the Diocese of Western New York there are
five deaconesses, with their associates and helpers,
under the direction of the bishop of the diocese.</p>

<p>In America, however, as in England, within the
Episcopal Church sisterhoods are more influential
and more rapid in their growth than are deaconess
institutions. In a list of the sisterhoods of the
Episcopal Church in America, given in the monthly
magazine devoted to women&#8217;s work in the
Church,<sup><a href="#fn.xiii.8" name="fna.xiii.8" id="fna.xiii.8">8</a></sup>
fourteen sisterhoods are named, one religious order
of widows, and two orders of deaconesses, one of
which is that which is now changed into the Sisterhood
of St. John the Evangelist.</p>

<p>In 1871 the Board of Missions of the Protestant
Episcopal Church discussed at some length the
relation of women&#8217;s work to the Church, and there
resulted increased interest in the subject of sisterhoods
and deaconess institutions. An effort has
been made to obtain for the order of deaconesses
a wider recognition than it now enjoys, as it simply
has the support of the bishop within whose diocese
the deaconesses are at work. To this end, in the<a
  id="png.221" name="png.221"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">221/</span>217</samp>
General Convention of 1880, a canon was presented
to the House of Bishops, and accepted by a large
vote. But it reached the Lower House too late for
consideration, and no further action has been taken
since that time.</p>

<p>In the Presbyterian Church of America the question
of the revival of the office of deaconess has
already claimed some attention. The late Dr. A. T.
McGill for many successive years earnestly
recommended the revival of the office to the members
of his classes in the theological seminary at
Princeton; and his views, matured by years of reflection,
were given for publication in an article
published in the <i>Presbyterian Review</i>, 1880.</p>

<p>In the Minutes of the General Assembly for 1884,
page 114, and of 1888, page 640, we find an overture
asking if the education of deaconesses is consistent
with Presbyterian polity, and, if so, should
they be ordained, answered in the negative in the following
words: &ldquo;<i>The Form of Government</i> declares
that in all cases the persons elected [deacons] must
be male members. (Chap. 13. 2.) In all ages of
the Church godly women have been appointed to
aid the officers of the Church in their labors, especially
for the relief of the poor and the infirm.
They rendered important service in the Apostolic
Church, but they do not appear to have occupied a<a
  id="png.222" name="png.222"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">222/</span>218</samp>
separate office, to have been elected by the people,
to have been ordained or installed. There is nothing
in our constitution, in the practice of our
Church, or in any present emergency, to justify the
creation of a new office.&rdquo; The next year an explanation
of this action, which so obviously contradicts
the facts of history, was asked, but the
committee declined to say any thing more.</p>

<p>The Southern Presbyterian Church has proceeded
further, and in the direction of the female diaconate,
as it is characterized in its main features wherever
it has existed, when it declares in its <i>Book of Church
Order</i>, adopted in 1879, that &ldquo;where it shall appear
needful, the church session may select and appoint
godly women for the care of the sick, of prisoners,
of poor widows and orphans, and, in general, in the
relief of the sick.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xiii.9" name="fna.xiii.9" id="fna.xiii.9">9</a></sup></p>

<p>In isolated Presbyterian congregations deaconesses
have already obtained recognition. At the
Pan-Presbyterian Council, held in Philadelphia in
1880, Fritz Fliedner, the son of Dr. Theodor Fliedner,
was present as a member, and through the influence
of his words the Corinthian Avenue Presbyterian
Church set apart five deaconesses, whose<a
  id="png.223" name="png.223"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">223/</span>219</samp>
duty it should be to care for the poor and sick belonging
to the congregation.</p>

<div class="longquote">
<p>&ldquo;More recently the Third Presbyterian Church
of Los Angeles, Cal., empowered its three deacons
to choose three women from the congregation to
co-operate with them in their work, granting them
seats and votes in the board&#8217;s monthly
meeting.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xiii.10" name="fna.xiii.10" id="fna.xiii.10">10</a></sup>
</p>
</div>

<p>The very interesting article from which the quotation
has just been made seems to think the term
&ldquo;deaconess&rdquo; a misnomer for the Kaiserswerth
deaconess, as she belongs to a community, whereas
the deaconess of the early Church was attached
to a congregation and belonged to a single church
as an officer; but it may well be questioned
whether the class of duties assigned to the deaconess
of the early Church and of modern times
alike, that is, the nursing of the sick, the care of the
infirm in body and mind, the succoring of the unfortunate,
and the education of children, are not the
main characteristics of the office of a deaconess,
while the fact of her connection with a number of
like-minded women in community life is merely an
external feature of the office as it has developed in
the nineteenth century. Whatever form the question<a
  id="png.224" name="png.224"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">224/</span>220</samp>
may assume, with the Presbyterian churches
of Scotland and England so far committed to the
adoption of the office of the deaconess as an
effective part of the organization of the Church, it
seems inevitable that the Presbyterian Church of
America will have to meet this question in the near
future.</p>

<p>The Methodist Episcopal Church of America,
although occupying itself with the question of the
diaconate of women later than any of the denominations
previously mentioned, by its acceptance of
the office and by making it an inherent part of its
ecclesiastical organization has taken a higher ground
than any Protestant body, with the exception of the
Church of Scotland. The Methodist Episcopal
Church has ever offered a freer scope for the activities
of its women members than any other body of
Christians save the Quakers, who are still the leaders
in this respect; but it may be questioned if any
furnishes a larger number who are actively engaged
in promoting philanthropic and religious measures.</p>

<p>The honor of practically beginning the deaconess
work in connection with the Methodist Episcopal
Church in the United States belongs to Mrs. Lucy
Rider Meyer, of the Chicago Training-school, who,
during the summer months of 1887, aided by eight
earnest Christian women, worked among the poor,<a
  id="png.225" name="png.225"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">225/</span>221</samp>
the sick, and the needy of that great city without
any reward of man&#8217;s giving. In the autumn the
Home opened in a few hired rooms, and Miss Thoburn
came to be its first superintendent. The story
of the growth of the work, the securing of a permanent
home, and the enlargement of its resources
is a most interesting one.<sup><a href="#fn.xiii.11" name="fna.xiii.11" id="fna.xiii.11">11</a></sup></p>

<p>The Rock River Conference, within whose boundaries
the Chicago Home is situated, had from the
beginning an earnest sympathy and confidence in
the work as it was developing in its midst. A memorial
was prepared, and was presented to the General
Conference in May, 1888, by the Rock River
Conference, through its Conference delegates, asking
for Church legislation with reference to deaconesses.
At the same time the Bengal Annual Conference,
through Dr. J.&nbsp;M. Thoburn, also presented
a memorial asking for the institution of an order
of deaconesses who should have authority to administer
the sacrament to the women of India. Our
missionaries in India have long felt the need of
some way of ministering to the converted women
who are closely secluded in zenana life, and who,
though sick and dying, are precluded by the customs<a
  id="png.226" name="png.226"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">226/</span>222</samp>
of the country from any religious service of
comfort or consolation that male missionaries can
render. If it had been possible for our women missionaries
to administer the sacrament many Indian
women could have been received into the Church.
All of the papers and memorials on this subject
were put into the hands of a committee, of which
Dr. J.&nbsp;M. Thoburn (afterward made missionary
bishop to India and Malaysia) was chairman; and
the report of the committee was as follows:</p>

<div class="bigquote">
<h5><span style="font-variant: normal;">&ldquo;</span>THE NEW OFFICE OF DEACONESSES IN THE
METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH.</h5>

<p>&ldquo;For some years past our people in Germany
have employed this class of workers with the most
blessed results, and we rejoice to learn that a successful
beginning has recently been made in the
same direction in this country. A home for deaconesses
has been established in Chicago, and
others of a similar character are proposed in other
cities. There are also a goodly number of similar
workers in various places; women who are deaconesses
in all but name, and whose number might be
largely increased if a systematic effort were made
to accomplish this result. Your committee believes
that God is in this movement, and that the Church<a
  id="png.227" name="png.227"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">227/</span>223</samp>
should recognize the fact and provide some simple
plan for formally connecting the work of these excellent
women with the Church and directing their
labors to the best possible results. They therefore
recommend the insertion of the following paragraphs
in the Discipline, immediately after &para;&nbsp;198,
relating to exhorters:</p>


<h5><span style="font-variant: normal;">&ldquo;</span>DEACONESSES.</h5>

<p>&ldquo;1. The duties of the deaconesses are to minister
to the poor, visit the sick, pray with the dying,
care for the orphan, seek the wandering, comfort the
sorrowing, save the sinning, and, relinquishing
wholly all other pursuits, devote themselves in a
general way to such forms of Christian labor as may
be suited to their abilities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;2. No vow shall be exacted from any deaconess,
and any one of their number shall be at liberty to
relinquish her position as a deaconess at any time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;3. In every Annual Conference within which
deaconesses may be employed, a Conference board
of nine members, at least three of whom shall be
women, shall be appointed by the Conference to
exercise a general control of the interests of this form
of work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;4. This board shall be empowered to issue certificates
to duly qualified persons, authorizing them<a
  id="png.228" name="png.228"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">228/</span>224</samp>
to perform the duties of deaconesses in connection
with the Church, provided that no person shall receive
such certificate until she shall have served a
probation of two years of continuous service, and shall
be over twenty-five years of age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;5. No person shall be licensed by the board of
deaconesses except on the recommendation of a
Quarterly Conference, and said board of deaconesses
shall be appointed by the Annual Conference
for such term of service as the Annual Conference
shall decide, and said board shall report both the
names and work of such deaconesses annually, and
the approval of the Annual Conference shall be
necessary for the continuance of any deaconess in
her work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;6. When working singly each deaconess shall be
under the direction of the pastor of the church with
which she is connected. When associated together
in a home all the members of the home shall be
subordinate to and directed by the superintendent
placed in charge.<span style="float: right;">&ldquo;<span class="smc">J.&nbsp;M. Thoburn</span>, <i>Chairman</i>.</span>
</p>

<p class="right nobrk" style="clear: both;">&ldquo;<span class="smc">A.&nbsp;B. Leonard</span>, <i>Secretary</i>.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>The adoption of this report made its contents a
portion of the organic law of the Church.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if there was any measure taken at
the General Conference of 1888 that will be more<a
  id="png.229" name="png.229"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">229/</span>225</samp>
far-reaching in its results than that which instituted
the office of deaconess. The full and complete
recognition accorded by the highest authority of
the Church commended it to the people, who
showed a remarkable readiness to accept the provisions.
Nearly simultaneously, at important points
distinct from each other, steps were taken to establish
deaconess homes, and to provide lectures and
practical training to educate deaconesses for their
work.</p>

<p>The terms of the law in which the Conference
action was expressed were not closely defined. It
was felt that in establishing a new office for a great
Church there must be room for a wide interpretation,
to meet the various exigencies that will arise.
It is true, also, that there can be no final interpretation
until there shall be a basis of experience
wide enough and varied enough to furnish facts
that will justify us in forming conclusions from
them. Still it was thought by those who were
practically engaged in the work that there should
be a common agreement on certain practical
points: What was to be the training that the deaconesses
were to receive during the two years
of &ldquo;continuous service?&rdquo; What was to be their
distinctive garb? What was to be the relation
of the deaconess homes, that were arising, to the<a
  id="png.230" name="png.230"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">230/</span>226</samp>
Conference board appointed by the Annual Conference?
To discuss these and other questions a
Conference was held in Chicago, December 20 and
21, 1888, of those who were actively engaged in the
work. The outcome of the deliberations was the
&ldquo;Plan for Securing Uniformity in the Deaconess
Movement.&rdquo; Regulations were suggested concerning
homes and their connection with the Conference
boards, conditions of admission were agreed upon,
and a Course of Study and Plan for Training
recommended.<sup><a href="#fn.xiii.12" name="fna.xiii.12" id="fna.xiii.12">12</a></sup>
Of course the recommendations set
forth in the &ldquo;Plan&rdquo; are not obligatory, but there
has been remarkable unanimity so far in accepting
them.</p>

<p>In addition to the Chicago Deaconess Home, and
the branch in New Orleans, there is the Elizabeth
Gamble House in Cincinnati, of which Miss Thoburn
is superintendent; the Home in New York
city, instituted by the Board of the Church Extension
and Missionary Society, under the superintendence
of Miss Layton; the home in Detroit,
under the auspices of the Home Missionary Society;
and homes under way or projected in Philadelphia,
St. Louis, and Minneapolis; while individually
deaconesses are employed in Kansas City,<a
  id="png.231" name="png.231"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">231/</span>227</samp>
Jersey City, Troy, and Albany. It is also well to
add that since his return to India, Bishop Thoburn
has opened a deaconess house in Calcutta, with
four American ladies as deaconesses, while at
Muttra a second home has been opened, of which
Miss Sparkes, so long connected with our mission
work in India, is superintendent.</p>

<p>Pastor Fliedner thought it strange that in the
New World where there is such ceaseless activity in
good works, the deaconess cause should make such
slow progress; but the season of sowing had to
precede that of reaping, and it seems now as though
the fullness of time had arrived for the incorporation
into the agencies of the churches of America of the
priceless activities of Christian deaconesses.</p>

<h3 class="newchap">CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<h4>THE MEANS OF TRAINING AND THE FIELD OF WORK
FOR DEACONESSES IN AMERICA.</h4>


<p><span class="smc">The</span> deaconesses of the early Church differed
from those of modern times, as we have seen, in
being directly responsible to a church society, and
in belonging to a church congregation in numbers
of two or more. Modern life shows a strong tendency
to organization. Wherever there are workers
in a common cause they are banded together
in societies and associations. It was in accordance
with the spirit of the age in which he lived that
Fliedner united his workers in the Rhenish-Westphalian
Deaconess Society, in 1836. It was a
happy inspiration&mdash;shall we not say a <i>providential</i>
one?&mdash;that furnished a convenient organization for
the office under present conditions. The mother-houses
in Germany offered good working-models,
and their practical advantages were so obvious that
in whatever Protestant denomination the diaconate
of women has revived, it has been in connection
with these homes. There is no place where the<a
  id="png.233" name="png.233"></a><samp class="pgmark"
 ><span class="png">233/</span>229</samp>
training of a deaconess in all its aspects can be so
well obtained as in the deaconess home and training-school,
which is our synonym for the German
mother-house.</p>

<p>Besides the advantages of a permanent home, under
careful supervision, to which the probationers
and deaconesses have access, in such a home care
is taken to train the deaconesses in the doctrines
of the Church, and there is an atmosphere favorable
to the virtues of faith and devotion that the work
demands. The deaconesses are never allowed to
forget that they serve in a threefold capacity:
&ldquo;Servants of the Lord Jesus; servants of the sick
and poor, &lsquo;for Jesus&#8217; sake;&rsquo; servants one to another.&rdquo;
The motto of the indomitable little republic
of Switzerland, &ldquo;All for each and each for all,&rdquo;
might well be accepted as that characteristically
belonging to them.</p>

<p>Then, too, there is a tradition of service in such
a home. One deaconess learns from another. The
physician is at hand to give his suggestions and
medical instruction, and the lectures on Church
history, on the history of missions, and on methods
of evangelization make the home a center of information
on all questions that affect the usefulness
of the office. There is no other one place in which
to obtain the practical and theoretical instruction<a
  id="png.234" name="png.234"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">234/</span>230</samp>
that is needed for the education of a deaconess
well equipped for her work.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the deaconess home offers a wide
and varied field for those possessing different gifts.
None can be so highly educated and cultivated that
places cannot be found to utilize their talents to
good advantage; while those who are sadly lacking
in the education of the schools can, by talent, untiring
industry, and energy make up for defects in
early training.</p>

<p>The field of work of the deaconess in modern
times is a large one. It would be easier to define
what it is not than what it is. In orphanages, in
asylums for fallen women, in women&#8217;s prisons, in
reform schools, in Sunday-schools, infant schools,
and higher schools, in classes among working-girls
and servants, in industrial homes, in asylums for
the blind and deaf and dumb, in hospitals of various
kinds, and in churches, working under the direction
of the pastor&mdash;in all of these relations and many
others we find deaconesses in Germany, France,
England, and other European countries.</p>

<p>The service in hospitals seems especially incumbent
upon Christian women, and in the early history
of these institutions we find deaconesses mentioned
in connection with them.</p>

<p>Before the birth of Christ hospitals were unknown.<a
  id="png.235" name="png.235"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">235/</span>231</samp>
It is true that in Rome and Athens a certain provision
was made for the poor, and largesses were
given them from time to time. But this was done
from motives of political expediency, and not from
sympathy or commiseration with their ills. But as
soon as the early Christians were free to practice
their religion openly, hospitals arose in all the great
cities. In the latter half of the fourth century the
distinguished Christian teacher, Ephrem the Syrian,
in Edessa, placed rows of beds for the sick and
starving. His contemporary, Basil, the great bishop
of C&aelig;sarea, founded a number of institutions for
strangers, the poor, and the sick, caring especially
for the lepers.<sup><a href="#fn.xiv.1" name="fna.xiv.1" id="fna.xiv.1">1</a></sup>
Little houses were built closely
together, but so that the patients could be separated
one from another, and cared for separately. Even
at that early date the hospitals were arranged into
divisions for either sex, as they are at the present
time. To use a modern phrase, the wards of the
men patients were placed under the charge of a
deacon while the deaconesses ministered to the sick
of their own sex, according as their services were
required. &ldquo;It was a rule for the deacons and deaconesses
to seek for the unfortunate day by day, and
to inform the bishops, who in turn, accompanied<a
  id="png.236" name="png.236"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">236/</span>232</samp>
by a priest, visited the sick and needy of all
classes.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xiv.2" name="fna.xiv.2" id="fna.xiv.2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>In the Middle Ages there were orders of Hospitallers,
consisting of laymen, monks, and knights,
who devoted themselves entirely to the care of the
sick. Under their influence great and splendid
hospitals were built, of which the old Hôtel Dieu
in Paris was a conspicuous example. The Hospital
of the Holy Ghost in Rome, and the service of the
same order, originated like hospitals all over Europe.
In late years, with the development of medical
and surgical art, hospital arrangements have
arrived at a degree of perfection never before
known; and the care of the sick, as it has been
studied and practiced by Protestant deaconesses
and Catholic Sisters of Mercy, has also greatly improved.</p>

<p>The state to which the hospitals had degenerated
in Fliedner&#8217;s time, and the need of experienced
nurses who should be actuated by the highest
Christian motives, were among the strong reasons
he advanced for providing the Church with deaconesses
as helpers. Here are his words:<sup><a href="#fn.xiv.3" name="fna.xiv.3" id="fna.xiv.3">3</a></sup>
&ldquo;The poor<a
  id="png.237" name="png.237"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">237/</span>233</samp>
sick people lay heavily on my mind. How often
had I seen them neglected, their bodily wants miserably
provided for, their spiritual needs quite forgotten,
withering away in their often unhealthy
rooms like leaves in autumn; for how many cities,
even those having large populations, were without
hospitals! And I have seen many on my travels in
Holland, Brabant, England, and Scotland, as in our
own Germany; I often found the portals of glittering
marble, but the nursing and care were wretched.
Physicians complained bitterly of the drunkenness
and immorality of the attendants, and what shall I
say of the spiritual care? In many hospitals preachers
we&#8217;re no longer found; hospital chaplains yet
more seldom. In the pious olden time these men
were always in such institutions, especially in the
Netherlands, where evangelical hospitals bore the
beautiful name of &ldquo;God&#8217;s house,&rdquo; because it was
recognized that God especially visits the inmates of
such houses, to draw them to himself. Do not such
wrongs cry to heaven? Is not our Lord&#8217;s reproachful
word addressed to us, &lsquo;I was sick and in prison
and ye visited me not?&rsquo; And shall not our Christian
women be capable and willing to undertake
the care of the sick for Christ&#8217;s sake?&rdquo; It was by
such words, and similar ones, as in his famous appeal
&ldquo;Freiwillige vor&rdquo; (Volunteers to the front!)<a
  id="png.238" name="png.238"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">238/</span>234</samp>
which he sent out from <ins class="transcriber"
  title="Transcriber's note: original has 'Würtemberg'">Wurtemberg</ins> to Basel in
1842, that he aroused the Christian women of Germany
to give themselves to this service. By their
aid he instituted a system of nursing that has
changed the aspect of every hospital ward in Germany;
and, through the training that Florence
Nightingale enjoyed at Kaiserswerth, the reform
that was there instituted passed to England, and
has effected a transformation in the entire hospital
system of England.</p>

<p>In Germany deaconesses are often trained to special
duties that are required in hospitals for certain
diseases or certain classes of patients, and they
are becoming so skillful in their duties that the
present system of hospital nursing could not be
continued without their aid.</p>

<p>The nursing care of deaconesses in insane asylums
is especially valuable. The large and well-ordered
Insane Asylum for Female Patients in
Kaiserswerth, with its long lists of cases soundly
cured, shows how healthful and important is the
quiet, constant influence of intelligent Christian attendance
upon those who are mentally unsound.</p>

<p>The usefulness of deaconesses as care-takers in
all kinds of hospitals and homes for the aged, and
asylums of every description, is so apparent that it
does not need to be dwelt upon. The <i>crèche</i>, or<a
  id="png.239" name="png.239"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">239/</span>235</samp>
day home, where infants and young children can
be sheltered and watched during the day while their
mothers are at work, is an institution that started
in Paris in 1834, through the efforts of M. Marbeau,
one of the mayors of a district of the city. This
is now incorporated into the government system of
Paris, and the idea has spread to neighboring lands,
so that such homes are found in many of the cities
in South Germany and Switzerland. It is true that
there are no nurses that can care for children as the
true mother, but where mothers have to be absent
from morning until night engaged at hard work, and
the little ones are left neglected at home, or in the
care of other children who are themselves young
enough to need very nearly the same attention that
is bestowed on the infants; or where the mothers
are such in name, but in reality are failing in every
quality which we attach to that sacred office; or
where the foundling hospital is the only alternative
to which the real mother, confronted by the necessity
of earning bread for herself and child, can
turn&mdash;in such cases the <i>crèche</i> is a real benefaction
whose existence has enabled families to keep together,
and children to be given a chance in life who
otherwise would have had small prospect of keeping
soul and body together.</p>

<p>There is another institution, called the waiting-school,<a
  id="png.240" name="png.240"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">240/</span>236</samp>
where children from two to four years of
age are received, whose parents both go daily to
work, and who would be left to wander about the
streets unless this place of refuge were opened to
them. The <i>crèche</i>, or day home, seeks only to
watch over the infants who are put in its care, or
to amuse them and keep them contented; the waiting-school
goes further, and tries to give the little
ones some ideas of discipline and the elementary
beginnings of instruction. Fliedner, who was a
lover of children, took great interest in both these
institutions, and in his school for infant-school teachers
prepared deaconesses especially for the duties
that are required in teachers of this class. The
motherly heart, the gift of story-telling and singing,
a pleasant and unruffled demeanor, the quiet but
firm inculcation of order and obedience&mdash;these and
other qualities Fliedner sought to develop in instructors
for these schools.</p>

<p>The day homes have already been introduced
into many places in the United States, and often
cover the field of both the <i>crèche</i> and waiting-school,
but there is a wide opportunity for the extension
of their usefulness; and whether in the future,
when the demands upon Christian deaconesses
shall be much more multiplex than they are now, it
may be necessary to provide special training for<a
  id="png.241" name="png.241"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">241/</span>237</samp>
Christian teachers in America for such special work,
time alone can decide. The question of Christian
education is one that has not yet been determined
in its full extent. In the year 1800 Mother Barat,
of the Catholic Church, founded the order of Sisters
of the Sacred Heart, which is especially devoted to
the education of daughters belonging to the higher
social ranks. At her death it numbered three
thousand five hundred members, and had over seventy
establishments, which are located in every civilized
land. It cannot be maintained that the education
given in these schools is either extensive or
profound, but the influence of the order upon the
women whom it has reached has been both. Fliedner,
at Kaiserswerth, went as far as his age and
environments would permit him to go. He provided
schools where teachers were prepared as instructors
for all grades of schools, from the most
elementary up to the girls&#8217; high-schools; and no
other institution in Germany, with one or two exceptions,
such as the Victoria Institute at Berlin,
yet offers positions to women teachers of a higher
grade than is afforded by these schools. But in
other lands, where the educational facilities for
women are far beyond those that Germany can offer
at the present time, positions of higher importance
and wider influence are held by women; and<a
  id="png.242" name="png.242"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">242/</span>238</samp>
it is an important question for the future what class
of women shall fill these places. If Fliedner had
had to meet the problem we can imagine he would
have done so with the boldness and energy that he
showed in solving those that his times and circumstances
afforded him. He would, doubtless, have
enlisted among his deaconesses those whose talents
gave him reason to provide them with the widest
training the schools can offer; and then he would
have endeavored to place them where they could do
the most effective service for Christ and his Church.
It may be that in the future which opens before the
women of the Methodist Episcopal Church of America
there will be just such questions seeking and
finding solution.</p>

<p>Doubtless at the present time the deaconess
who will answer to the greatest number of immediate
wants is the &ldquo;parish-deaconess,&rdquo; or the
home mission deaconess, as we may call her. Her
usefulness has been well tested in the great cities
of Germany, France, and England, as we have
seen. Perhaps nowhere is her work better appreciated
than in London, the greatest city of modern
times. The tendency of this age of manufactures
and commerce is to attract laborers and workers
from country homes, where work has become less
open to them through the increased use of agricultural<a
  id="png.243" name="png.243"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">243/</span>239</samp>
machines of all kinds, into cities, where factories,
shops, counting-rooms, and offices constantly
afford openings. London has felt the full force of
this movement. In 1836 her population was about
equal to that of New York, including Brooklyn and
Jersey City. Now the great city contains 5,500,000
inhabitants. It is growing at the rate of over
100,000 a year, nor is there any influence at work
to stop its growth. The same causes that produce
it are constantly at work. The great massing of the
population together, with the unequaled increase
in the wealth of the people, make the contrast of
riches and poverty striking and obvious. The west
of London, with its vast wealth, its homes of refinement
and elegance, and its appliances for the
enjoyment of art, science, and literature, is separated
from the poverty, the degradation, the misery, and
the sorrow of the East End by a gulf as great as that
which separated Lazarus from Dives. It is difficult for
those who are at ease, whose lives, to use Wordsworth&#8217;s
felicitous phrase, are made up &ldquo;of cheerful
yesterdays and confident to-morrows&rdquo;&mdash;it is difficult
for such even faintly to apprehend the dullness,
the drudgery, and the hardships of those who, even
at the best estate, are obliged to live in such surroundings.
The vast metropolis a few years ago
was for a short time shaken out of its lethargy by<a
  id="png.244" name="png.244"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">244/</span>240</samp>
a voice that would be heard, when <i>The Bitter Cry
of Outcast London</i> was published. &ldquo;Few who will
read these pages have any conception of what these
pestilential human rookeries are, where tens of
thousands are crowded together amid horrors which
call to mind what we have heard of the middle passage
of the slave-ship. To go into them you have
to penetrate courts reeking with poisonous malodorous
gases arising from accumulations of sewerage,
refuse scattered in all directions, and often flowing
beneath your feet; courts, many of them, which the
sun never penetrates, which are never visited by a
breath of fresh air. You have to ascend rotten
stair-cases, grope your way along dark and filthy
passages swarming with vermin. Then, if you are
not driven back by the intolerable stench, you may
gain admittance into the dens in which these thousands
of beings herd together. Eight feet square!
That is about the average size of many of these
rooms&hellip;. Where there are beds they are simply
heaps of dirty rags, shavings, or straw, but for
the most part the miserable beings find rest only
upon the filthy boards&hellip;. There are men and
women who lie and die day by day in their
wretched single room, sharing all the family
trouble, enduring the hunger and the cold, without
hope, without a single ray of comfort, until God<a
  id="png.245" name="png.245"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">245/</span>241</samp>
curtains their staring eyes with the merciful film of
death.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xiv.4" name="fna.xiv.4" id="fna.xiv.4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Such are the places where the deaconesses of
East London go in and out from morn to eve, like
angels of mercy, succoring the miserable and unhappy,
often rebuking vice, and encouraging with
friendly words those who are worn and discouraged
in the battle of life. Here they nurse the
sick, hold mothers&#8217; meetings, start evening classes
for working young men, and gather the children
of all ages in every kind of class that can interest
and instruct them. They are always ready to provide
for individual cases that they meet. If they
find a friendless young servant-girl who is out of
work, they send her to the servants&#8217; home, where,
for very little payment, sometimes nothing at all,
she can be taken care of long enough to give her
fresh courage and strength. Then she is aided in
seeking a situation, and so she is saved from the
innumerable temptations to vice and misery that
are sure to assail her if she stands alone.</p>

<p>Many of these deaconesses are educated women,
gladly devoting their whole life and energies to the
work, and who with &ldquo;food and raiment&rdquo; are quite
content. Nothing but a strong indomitable faith
in God&#8217;s love and promises can stand the strain of<a
  id="png.246" name="png.246"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">246/</span>242</samp>
such work. But if there is the faith and love to
deny self and dare all &ldquo;for the love of Christ and in
His name,&rdquo; where can such rewards for labor be
found? The dull streets become filled with friends,
sodden countenances brighten, the little children
come with loving faces and gladdened hearts, and
the deaconess is recognized as interpreting to the
hearts of these weary, forlorn, helpless people the
love of God who, when He came upon earth, shared
the burdens that belonged to His humanity. He came
as a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief,
and it was the &ldquo;common people&rdquo; that heard Him
gladly. The deaconess, in her distinctive dress, is
becoming a well-known figure in the east of London,
and not only protected but recommended by
her garb, she visits the lowest parts of the city
without danger. Just such deaconesses are needed
in the cities of America. The cities of the United
States are increasing as wonderfully as the great
cities of the Old World. With the surplus population
of Europe pouring in upon us by the hundreds
of thousands annually our country is doubling in
numbers every twenty-five years; and the growth
of the towns absorbs a larger proportion of this multitude
than does the country. The cities attract
the immigrants because there they find others of
their own nationality. In some cities there are<a
  id="png.247" name="png.247"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">247/</span>243</samp>
whole foreign colonies where the people speak a
foreign tongue, read foreign newspapers, and have
very few interests in common with the people of the
land in which they live. They continue the same
customs and the same habits of thought that belonged
to them in the Old World. Examples of
such colonies are found in the thirty thousand
Poles in Buffalo, and the sixty thousand Bohemians
in Chicago.</p>

<p>Then the cities offer attractions that are irresistible
to the young men and women from the country.
Thousands leave quiet country homes every
year, and, with no certain prospects before them,
cast themselves into the busy life of the nearest
great metropolis. In many places, especially in
New England, the villages number less, and farm
land is much less valuable than it was fifty years
ago. It is this massing of population that is causing
us already to experience some of the evils that
are old problems in the great cities of Europe.
There is the same gulf between the rich and the
poor, with the added element that the great mass
of the poor are composed of foreigners and their
children. And the difference in race is a hinderance
to a common ground of sympathy. A greater hinderance
is the difference in religious faith. The preponderating
number of native Americans are Protestants,<a
  id="png.248" name="png.248"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">248/</span>244</samp>
and their thoughts and beliefs are permeated
with the principles that their fathers held so
dear, and which they sacrificed home and country
to preserve. They hold a faith that is inseparably
connected with free institutions, personal liberty,
and personal responsibility. But the mass of foreigners
that are in the great cities largely belong to
the working-class, and, with the large proportion of
the poor who are the wards of the city, are Roman
Catholic in faith, a faith that has little in sympathy
with republican institutions, and which least prepares
its followers to exercise the duties of citizens
of a republic. Keeping these facts in mind, the
statistics contained in the following extracts are of
telling force: &ldquo;If the laboring class should contribute
its due proportion to the congregations, the
churches, many of which are now half empty, would
not begin to hold the people. In 1880 there was
in the United States one evangelical organization
to every 516 of the population; in Boston, <i>counting
churches of all kinds</i>, there was but one to every
1,600 of the population; in Chicago, one to every
2,081; in New York, one to every 2,468; in St.
Louis, one to every 2,800.&rdquo; &ldquo;The worst of it is
that, instead of improving, the condition of things
has been growing worse every year. While the
prosperous classes are moving away to the suburbs,<a
  id="png.249" name="png.249"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">249/</span>245</samp>
and the laborers are being more densely
massed together in the heart of the city, the church
accommodations, even if fully used, are becoming
more inadequate to the needs of the community.
Including religious organizations of all sorts, New
York had in 1830 one place of worship for every
1,853 of its inhabitants; in 1840, one for every 1,840;
in 1850, one for every 2,095; in 1860, one for every
2,344; in 1870, one for every 2,004; in 1880, one
for every 2,468; and the religious history of Chicago
is even more noteworthy in this respect:
Chicago had in 1840 one church for every 747 of its
population; in 1851 there was one for every 1,009;
in 1862, one for every 1,301; in 1870, one for 1,593;
in 1880, one for 2,081; in 1885, one for 2,254.
All the large cities have districts which are destitute
of church accommodations, and have not seats
in Sunday-school for more than one tenth of their
children.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xiv.5" name="fna.xiv.5" id="fna.xiv.5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Have we not as great need of deaconesses as any
of the cities of the Old World? Most of our pastors
stand alone. They do not have the assistant
curates and pastors that are connected with large
city churches in Berlin and London. When the
minister makes pastoral calls, and, entering working-men&#8217;s
homes, finds sickness and scanty resources,<a
  id="png.250" name="png.250"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">250/</span>246</samp>
he has no deaconess to call to his aid with her
cheerful words of encouragement and her loving
sympathy, that are better than money and medicine.
It is not charity alone that is wanted in such cases;
it is the knowledge of how to use proper means to
make the sick one comfortable, how to lessen the
burden on the family that a small additional call
for work and care has so sadly taxed; how to
enlighten the ignorance that is so common without
wounding the susceptibilities that are so human.
For, to quote the words of the Christ in the <i>Vision
of Sir Launfal</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;Not what we give, but what we share,<br />
For the gift without the giver is bare;<br />
Who gives himself with his alms feeds three:&mdash;<br />
Himself, his hungry neighbor, and Me.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<p>It is for such ministrations that we need deaconesses
in every evangelical church of the United
States; may the women that are ready to &ldquo;publish
the tidings&rdquo; be &ldquo;a great host.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="newchap">CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<h4>OBJECTIONS MET AND SUGGESTIONS OFFERED.</h4>


<p>&ldquo;<span class="smc">Success</span> and glory are the children of hard
work and God&#8217;s favor,&rdquo; is the inscription upon the
tablet erected in Christ&#8217;s Hospital, London, to the
memory of Sir Henry Maine.</p>

<p>Upon these two elements depends the future of
the deaconess cause in America. We are assured of
the one; will the other be forthcoming? Will the
individual members of the Church give this cause
their hearty support? Surely the facts that have
been stated must have convinced the judgment, but
perhaps there are certain prejudices to be overcome.
&ldquo;I fear that deaconesses too closely resemble
Catholic nuns for Protestants to accept them,&rdquo;
says one. No; these helpful Christian women are
thoroughly Protestant. Deaconesses are no Catholic
institution. Wherever they have appeared they
have been met by open antagonism from the Catholic
Church. Witness the calumnies with which
the papers of that capital have constantly assailed
the deaconess home of Paris.<a
  id="png.252" name="png.252"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">252/</span>248</samp></p>

<p>There is good in the Catholic sisterhoods, but
mingled with much that we disapprove. The deaconess
institutions have the good features, but have
avoided the ill. Much of the success of the Catholic
Church in winning the poor and in retaining its
influence over the lowly is due to the power exerted
by the sisters who go about from house to
house among the poor, and are received as friends.</p>

<p>There is a great army of Catholic sisters. It
is calculated that there are about 28,000 Sisters
of Vincent de Paul, 22,000 Franciscan Sisters caring
for the sick, 6,000 Sisters of the Holy Cross, 5,000
Sisters of Charles, making a total of about 60,000
sisters of various orders belonging to the Catholic
Church<sup><a href="#fn.xv.1" name="fna.xv.1" id="fna.xv.1">1</a></sup>
who are occupied with works of mercy.
The sisters engaged in education are often well-trained
and accomplished. The order of Charles
will not accept widows, orphans without property,
girls from asylums, or those that have served as
maids. As a rule, those that join it must make
some contribution of money to the order when
they are received. This order is small, but one of
the most active and aggressive of any. The great
number of the sisters, however, are women of few
advantages, taken from poor homes and lives of toil.<a
  id="png.253" name="png.253"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">253/</span>249</samp>
There is wisdom in this course, for a great deal of
the work to be done depends upon qualities that
can be developed by training, while the exceptional
education and talents are employed in the exceptional
places.</p>

<p>A contemplation of these facts just recorded
causes us better to understand the importance that
the co-operation of women has for the Catholic
Church. It causes us, too, to appreciate better the
opening before the Protestant women of all evangelical
churches, so wide, so all-embracing that every
variety of talent can find a place.</p>

<p>Gifts of clothes or food or fuel are not so well
appreciated as the respectful hearing which clothes
the teller with self-respect, the kind word and loving
sympathy that feed the heart, the inspiring consolations
of religious faith that animate and warm
the soul, and such gifts women of sympathetic
Christian hearts can ever render. As has been well
said, &ldquo;Shall the advantages of such a system be
monopolized by those who have so little else to
offer?&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xv.2" name="fna.xv.2" id="fna.xv.2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>You may say, &ldquo;I do not object to the deaconess
and her work, but I do object to her distinctive
dress. I do not believe in a uniform of charity.&rdquo;<a
  id="png.254" name="png.254"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">254/</span>250</samp>
But let us consider the arguments that can be
brought forward in favor of it. It is a distinctive
garb because its wearer is a distinctive officer of the
Church. Unless she were &ldquo;set apart&rdquo; by some
uniform immediately and widely recognized how
could she have the protection that is accorded her?
Alike in every land where she is known, as we have
seen, the deaconess can venture into any part of
the great cities at any hour, and is invariably treated
with respect. There is in the heart of the rudest
and most lawless some trace of chivalry which
recognizes the self-denying lives of these women.
Then, in making her visits, the deaconess
finds her dress an introduction that opens doors
that would otherwise remain closed to her. It certainly
is a convenient and economical garb, that
saves a great deal of time and money to the wearer.</p>

<p>Are not these advantages more than an offset to
an ill-defined objection to the dress because it has
been associated with women who are alien to our
Protestant faith? This is a minor matter, however,
and one that can be adjusted at liking.</p>

<p>You may say, &ldquo;I do not like to think of a woman
who is dear to me cut off from the pleasures of
home life, and devoted to a life-time of work among
those who, in many respects, must be repugnant to
her tastes. It does not seem so high and beautiful<a
  id="png.255" name="png.255"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">255/</span>251</samp>
a life as that which makes home a center, and carries
on its activities from there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there are many women debarred from the
pleasures of home life by God&#8217;s direct providence
to whom other duties and responsibilities have been
allotted. And then this work may not necessarily be
for life. It is true that when a Christian woman occupies
the position of a deaconess she must relinquish
wholly all other pursuits so long as she holds this
office. Neither without grave and weighty reasons
should she seek to leave it. It is her calling. The
period of probation has its uses, not only in making
the probationer familiar with the duties and tasks
demanded of her, but in giving her time to test the
strength of her call to service, that she may not,
through enthusiasm, lightly assume the duties of
the office, nor as lightly throw them aside.</p>

<p>But if a deaconess is called away to perform her
duties as a sister or daughter, or if she desires to
marry, she is free to do so, after giving due information
to those with whom she is connected in work.
Freedom and liberty are in every phase of this
office.</p>

<p>As to the highest life for a woman, an archbishop
of England well said some years ago, &ldquo;that
whatever life God gives to any woman is the
highest life for that woman,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;in<a
  id="png.256" name="png.256"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">256/</span>252</samp>
becoming a deaconess a woman devoting herself to
this life must believe that it is the highest life for
her, and that in it she gives herself wholly to the
Lord.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xv.3" name="fna.xv.3" id="fna.xv.3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>There should be no country like America for the
favorable development of the deaconess cause, because
in no other have women such large freedom
of action, and, if we may believe our friends, they
have improved it well. A distinguished English
historian has just given us what we are fain to accept
as words of just and discriminating praise. &ldquo;In
no other country have women borne so conspicuous
a part in the promotion of moral and philanthropic
causes&hellip;. Their services in dealing with charities
and reformatory institutions have been inestimable&hellip;. The
nation, as a whole, owes to the active
benevolence of its women, and their zeal in promoting
social reforms, benefits which the customs
of continental Europe would scarcely have permitted
women to confer&hellip;. Those who know the
work they have done and are doing in many a
noble cause will admire still more their energy,
their courage, their devotion. No country seems
to owe more to its women than America does,
nor to owe to them so much of what is best in<a
  id="png.257" name="png.257"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">257/</span>253</samp>
social institutions, and in the beliefs that govern
conduct.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xv.4" name="fna.xv.4" id="fna.xv.4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Nor in any denomination should we expect women
to be more ready to adopt this work than in the
Methodist Episcopal Church, because women members
have been accustomed to exercise nearly all the
obligations and duties, and many of the privileges,
that are accorded the laity of the great connection,
and they are prepared to accept new duties in new
relations. This Church has over a million women
enrolled as members, able to serve it in every capacity,
from the lady in her home dispensing gracious
Christian hospitality, to the one standing quite
alone, who will welcome, as a brevet of rank, this
new call to service. There are many such women
ready to respond. Many, too, whose hearts have
been left desolate by bereavement, who will be glad
to fill the empty hands and vacant life by work for
God and humanity. To such a woman the wide
world is her home; the dear ones of her family are
the poor and sick and needy who crave her aid.</p>

<p>The beautiful Mildmay motto is: &ldquo;They dwell
with the King for his work.&rdquo; There are thousands
of women all over the land who are ready to become
&ldquo;King&#8217;s Daughters&rdquo; in this additional sense<a
  id="png.258" name="png.258"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">258/</span>254</samp>
of the word. The possibility of what such women
can accomplish in the furtherance of God&#8217;s kingdom
upon earth has not begun to be fathomed.</p>

<p>Think of a great city church, with the manifold
interests clustering around it, left to the care of a
single pastor! He has not only the preparation of
his weekly sermons, the care of the social meetings
of the church, but a long line of other duties that
are equally important to maintain. He must perform
pastoral duties, push forward aggressive movements
in behalf of the masses not touched by the
church services, and fulfill public duties in connection
with great charities, philanthropies, and moral
reforms that he cannot neglect without injury. If
the efforts of such a pastor could be furthered by
one, two, or more deaconesses, as are many of the
pastors of the London churches, how greatly would
the working force of such a Church be increased!</p>

<p>It is true that we must develop the work in accordance
with our American ideas and institutions.
Through the study of the methods that have been
adopted in European institutions, and the experience
that has been there won through long years
of patient toil, we are prepared in a measure to start
where their work leaves off. But we shall find that
our circumstances require new adjustments, and
that we shall have our own problems to solve, so<a
  id="png.259" name="png.259"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">259/</span>255</samp>
that eventually our work will assume a distinctively
American form.</p>

<p>We have only to plant the seed and to give it
favorable conditions for growth. The outcome is
not ours: &ldquo;In the morning sow thy seed, and in
the evening withhold not thy hand.&rdquo; The results
are with Him who giveth the increase.</p>

<p>The practical question may occur to some one
who reads these pages, &ldquo;What shall I do to become
a deaconess?&rdquo; Write to the superintendent of the
nearest deaconess home, and ask for directions.
It is best not to multiply homes until we have a
larger number of trained deaconesses that are ready
to take charge of them, and until the number of
applicants desiring to enter them is much greater
than at present.</p>

<p>Many churches that need the services of a deaconess
will doubtless select one of their number
whose heart God has inclined to this service, and
will provide the means by which she can secure the
necessary training at a home and training-school.
There are many devout Christian women in every
community who have for years been deaconesses
in labors, if not in title and prerogatives. It is very
important for such women to give their sympathies
and fostering care to this new institution. If not
deaconesses by office, they can ally themselves as<a
  id="png.260" name="png.260"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">260/</span>256</samp>
associates. The associate is a real officer in many
of the deaconess establishments in London. Ladies
who have great sympathy with the cause, and
an earnest desire to do what they can to advance
it, give some portion of their time, their labor, or
their means to promote its interests. They will go
to the home and reside there for some weeks or
months, being under the direction of the superintendent
and filling all the duties of a sister. Or, if
such duties are not practicable, they will work in
behalf of the home, often securing the aid of those
whose assistance is most valuable. In some places
it is arranged that a woman who earns her bread
by daily toil shall be assigned to labor at her regular
vocation, consecrating a certain portion of her
wages (perhaps one twenty-fourth) to the cause with
which she is allied.</p>

<p>The Church has been accused of being too abstract,
too ideal, too far removed from the life of
the people in its every-day aspects. It is well for
Church members to examine themselves, and the
Church communities to which they belong, to judge
how much ground there is for such criticism.
None are so sharp-sighted as hostile critics, and
from none can such good lessons be learned. But
this accusation is not a new one, and the only effectual
way to meet it is to point to what the Church<a
  id="png.261" name="png.261"></a><samp class="pgmark"
  ><span class="png">261/</span>257</samp>
has accomplished. Over eighteen hundred years
ago, when John the Baptist was in danger of mistaking
our Lord, he sent to him, saying: &ldquo;Art
thou he that should come? or look we for another?&rdquo;
and the answer was: &ldquo;Go your way, and tell John
what things ye have seen and heard; how that the
blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed,
the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the
gospel is preached.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let us be prepared to make a similar answer to-day,
and the Church need fear no accusation of holding
aloof from the needs of the daily life of the
people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christianity, as it stands in the Bible and in our
creeds, will neither be read nor understood by millions;
Christianity as it is revealed in the loving
service of deaconesses will be recognized by the
dullest eyes.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xv.5" name="fna.xv.5" id="fna.xv.5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>We have reached a new departure in Methodism.
The Church has added another to its aggressive
forces. How is it to be received? What welcome
will be given it? May pastors and people, one and
all, be in that attitude of spirit where we shall respond
readily to the command: &ldquo;Whatsoever he
saith unto you, do it.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="smc">Yearly Expenditures at Kaiserswerth</h4>.


<p>While the book is in press the following interesting
statistics are received, which are deemed of
sufficient importance to insert here.</p>

<p>Receipts and expenditures of Kaiserswerth for
the three years from 1885 to 1888:</p>

<table summary="Receipts and expenditures of Kaiserswerth for
the three years from 1885 to 1888">
<tr>
<th> Year. </th><th></th><th> Receipts. </th><th></th><th> Expenses. </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>1885&ndash;1886</td><td>&hellip;&hellip;</td><td>333,476 m. 74 pf.</td><td style="width: 2em;">&nbsp;</td><td>331,812 m. 12 pf.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>1886&ndash;1887</td><td>&hellip;&hellip;</td><td>371,523 m. 46 pf.</td><td></td><td>370,626 m. 45 pf.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>1887&ndash;1888</td><td>&hellip;&hellip;</td><td>337,508 m. 14 pf.</td><td></td><td>492,384 m. 21 pf.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In the year 1887&ndash;1888, the excess of expenses
over receipts was caused by the construction of a
new building, and special funds were contributed
which more than met the deficit.</p>

<p>Rev. F.&nbsp;Fliedner, the son of Pastor Fliedner
further writes: &ldquo;This does not include the expenses
in the East and other foreign stations. In
truth, about six hundred thousand marks pass
yearly through our treasury.&rdquo; What an amount of
good accomplished by the yearly expenditure of
one hundred and fifty thousand dollars!</p>
